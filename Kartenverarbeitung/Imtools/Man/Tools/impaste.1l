NAME
     impaste  -  Paste an image atop a background and store in  a
     new file

SYNOPSIS
     impaste [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _b_a_c_k_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [_o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]

DESCRIPTION
     impaste pastes an input image atop a  background  image  and
     stores  the  result  in a new file or back in the background
     image file.

     If the input file contains multiple images, each input image
     is  pasted  onto  a  fresh  copy of the background image and
     added to the output file.  The output file contains one  new
     image for each input image.

     If the input and  background  files  each  contain  multiple
     images, a one-for-one mapping occurs where input image #1 is
     pasted atop background image #1, and so on.  The output file
     contains one new image for each input image.

     The input, background, and output image file formats may  be
     different.

OPTIONS
     impaste has a variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     If you don't specify an output file,  the  background  image
     file  is  treated as the output file.  This allows paste-in-
     place operations.

     The input image or the background image, but not  both,  may
     be taken from stdin.

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     The pasting location within the background image  is  speci-
     fied by:

          -xposition _x   Left edge of paste location
          -yposition _y   Top edge of paste location

     The paste location may be outside the bounds  of  the  input
     image.   The portion of the input image that lies within the
     bounds of the background image will be pasted.  (0,0) is the
     upper  left  corner of the image.  Both positions default to
     values that center  the  incoming  image  left-to-right  and
     top-to-bottom within the background image.

     By giving a repeat count in the  X  and  Y  directions,  the
     input  image  may  be  pasted  repeatedly to create a tiling
     effect using the following:

          -xrepeat _n_x        Number of times to paste horizontally
          -yrepeat _n_y        Number of times to paste vertically
          -xdirection _x_d_i_r   Horizontal tiling direction
          -ydirection _y_d_i_r   Vertical tiling direction

     -xrepeat and -yrepeat indicate how many times to  paste  the
     input  image  onto  the same background image.  A value of 1
     (default) pastes the image  once.   Values  greater  than  1
     repeat the paste in X and Y.  A value of 0 for either repeat
     count requests an "infinite" repeat that tiles the image  as
     many  times as necessary to reach the horizontal or vertical
     edge of the background image.

     -xdirection and -ydirection select how tiling should advance
     from image to image.  -xdirection takes one of the following
     as its argument:

          left    Tiling advances to the left
          right   Tiling advances to the right

     By default, tiling advances to the right.

     -ydirection takes one of the following as its argument:

          up     Tiling advances upward
          down   Tiling advances downward

     By default, tiling advances downward.

NOTES
     Pasting takes place without regard to  alpha  planes,  write
     protect planes, and so on.  The input image is always placed
     pixel-for-pixel atop the background image.

     Internally, an input image is converted to the same depth as
     the background image prior to being pasted.

     Pasting of non-RGB images can cause unexpected  results  but
     is  allowed.   Consider this scenario:  An input color index
     image uses color indexes 1, 2, and 3  for  red,  green,  and
     blue.   The  background color index image uses color indexes
     1, 2, and 3 as  well,  but  its  color  lookup  table  (CLT)
     defines  them  as  orange, white, and black.  When the input
     image is pasted atop the background image, its color indexes
     are copied across and use the background image's CLT.  Input
     pixels that used to be red become orange, input green pixels
     become  white,  and  input  blue pixels become black because
     they now reference the background image's CLT.  If  this  is
     not what you want, convert the images to RGB prior to invok-
     ing impaste.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To paste a logo at (10,20) on a background  image  and  save
     the result in a new file, use the following:

          impaste  logo.rgb  background.hdf  -xpos  10  -ypos  20
          result.rla

     To paste an image in the center of a background and save  it
     back in the same background file, use the following:

          impaste image.pix background.pix

     To tile a pattern across the whole background, use the  fol-
     lowing:

          impaste pattern.x -xpos 0 -ypos 0 -xrepeat 0 -yrepeat 0
          background.tiff

     To tile a pattern three times in X and none in  Y,  starting
     at (-10, -20), use the following:

          impaste pattern.ras -xrepeat  3  -xpos  -10  -ypos  -20
          background.ras
