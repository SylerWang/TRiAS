NAME
     imcopy  -  Copy a portion of an image to a new file

SYNOPSIS
     imcopy [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imcopy copies a portion of an input image to a new file.  If
     the  input  file contains multiple images, a portion of each
     input image is copied and written to the output  file.   The
     input and output image file formats may be different.

OPTIONS
     imcopy has a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     The region of the input image to be copied to a new file  is
     defined by four arguments:

          -xposition _x   Left edge of region
          -yposition _y   Top edge of region
          -xsize _w       Width of region
          -ysize _h       Height of region

     -xposition and -yposition specify the copy  region  position
     and  are  constrained  to  be within the bounds of the input
     image.  (0,0) is the upper left corner  of  the  image.   If
     these  options  are  not  given,  the  copy  region position
     defaults to a position that centers  the region  within  the
     input image.

     -xsize and -ysize give the size of the copy region  and  are
     constrained to fit within the bounds of the input image.  If
     these options are not given, the copy region defaults  to  a
     rectangle  whose  upper  left  corner  is  at the given copy
     region position, and which extends to the right  and  bottom
     edges of the input image.

NOTES
     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To copy from an Alias PIX file a 100x100 pixel region  whose
     upper  left corner is at (10,20) and store it to a Wavefront
     RLA file, use the following:

          imcopy picture.pix -xpos 10 -ypos 20 -xsize 100  -ysize
          100 clipart.rla

     To copy a 500x500 pixel region from the  center  of  an  HDF
     file and write it to a TIFF file, use the following:

          imcopy picture.hdf -xsize 500 -ysize 500 newpic.tiff

     To copy the top 20 scanlines from an XWD file and  store  it
     to a new XWD file, use the following:

          imcopy window.xwd -ypos 0 -ysize 20 border.xwd

     To copy an entire input GIF image to a  PCX  file,  use  the
     following:

          imcopy incoming.gif outgoing.pcx

     With no copy region specified, the actions of imcopy default
     to  the  same  as  the  SDSC  image  format  conversion tool
     imconv(1IM), but they take a little longer.

     the  underlying  format  read  and write code.  The names of
     these man pages begin with the letters "im" followed by  the
     format  name.  For example, the name of the TIFF man page is
