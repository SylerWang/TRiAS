NAME
     imrotate  -  rotate an image

SYNOPSIS
     imrotate [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imrotate reads each image in the  input  file,  rotates  it,
     then  writes  it  to  the output file.  The input and output
     image file formats may be different.

OPTIONS
     imrotate has a variety of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Rotation           How the image should be rotated
          Filling            How to fill in blank corners in the rotated image

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Rotation Options
     -rotate _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
          The -rotate option selects the  number  of  degrees  by
          which  to rotate the image.  Degree values may be posi-
          tive or negative  floating  point  angles.   Using  the
          right-hand  rule,  positive  values  rotate  the  image
          counter-clockwise  while  negative  values  rotate  the
          image clockwise.

          If -rotate is not given, imrotate does not  rotate  the
          image  at  all  and its actions default to an expensive
          copy of the image from the input  file  to  the  output
          file.

  Filling Options
     Rotating  an  image  creates  a  non-axis-aligned  rectangle
     (image  edges are diagonal rather than horizontal and verti-
     cal).  Pixel storage, however,  must  be  into  axis-aligned
     rectangles  (horizontal and vertical edges only).  So, imro-
     tate copies the  rotated  image  into  a  larger  background
     axis-aligned  rectangle  and stores the result to the output
     file.

     The placement of the rotated image into a  background  axis-
     aligned  rectangular  image leaves the four triangular image
     corners empty.  These empty corners may be filled in using a
     variety of fill options similar to those found on imfill.

     Fill options allow specific image channels to be filled with
     single values or a range of values in a horizontal or verti-
     cal gradient.

     Fill values are selected using one or more of the  following
     fill options:

          Option              Fill each pixel's

          -red _r_a_n_g_e          red component
          -green _r_a_n_g_e        green component
          -blue _r_a_n_g_e         blue component
8          _________________________________________
          -mono _r_a_n_g_e         monochrome component
          -index _r_a_n_g_e        color index component
8          _________________________________________

          -intensity _r_a_n_g_e    intensity component
8          _________________________________________
          -alpha _r_a_n_g_e        alpha compoent

     Multiple fill options may be given, as long as color  spaces
     are  not  mixed.   For  instance,  -index  for filling color
     indexes is incompatible with -red for filling the  red  com-
     ponent  of  RGB triplets.  Likewise, -hue for filling pixels
     based upon an HSI color space hue value is incompatible with
     -blue for filling with blue in the RGB color space.  See the
     imintro(3IM) man page for a description of the RGB  and  HSI
     color spaces.

     If imrotate is directed to fill the alpha  component  of  an
     image  that does not have an alpha channel, an alpha channel
     is created and initialized to 0s (transparent).

     If imrotate is directed to fill a pixel component that  does
     not exist in the input image (except for alpha), an error is
     reported.

     Input image components not selected for filling  by  a  fill
     option are initialized to zeroes.

     Each of the fill options can accept  an  argument  giving  a
     single  value, or range of values with which to fill.  Value
     _r_a_n_g_e syntax takes any one of the following forms:

          _r_a_n_g_e   Fill with values of
8          ____________________________________________________________
          _n       _n only.
          _n-      _n through the maximum legal value for the component.

          _n-_m     _n through _m.

     There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  _n need not be
     a value less than _m.

     When filling with a  single  value,  the  entire  background
     rectnagle is set to the same value.

     When a range of fill values are given, such as -red 0-255 or
     -intensity  0.6-0.2,  the  fill region will be filled with a
     gradation, or ramp, as selected by  the  -graduate  option's
     argument:

          option                 Meaning
8          ____________________________________________________________
          -graduate none         Fill with a constant value
          -graduate horizontal   Fill with a horizontal ramp (default)
          -graduate vertical     Fill with a vertical ramp

     none, horizontal, and vertical may each  be  abbreviated  to
     the fewest unique letters.

     The horizontal ramp for a graduated  fill  starts  from  the
     first  fill  value at the left edge of the image and goes to
     the second fill value at the right edge.  The vertical  ramp
     for  a  graduated fill goes from the first fill value at the
     top edge of the image to the second fill value at the bottom
     edge.

NOTES
     imrotate's fill options may used for a variety  of  effects.
     In  the  simplest  case, the fill options may be set to fill
     the image corners with a color that matches  the  background
     color of the rotated image.

     In a more complex use of imrotate's fill options, the  back-
     ground  corners  may  be  set  to  transparent alpha channel
     values.  Then, using  the  Image  Tools  digital  compositor
     imcomp(1IM),  the  rotated  image  can  be composited onto a
     background image of arbitrary complexity.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     Rotate an image 170 degrees:
     imrotate image.rgb -rotate 170 rotated_image.rgb

     Rotate an image 45 dgrees and fill the corners  with  bright
     red and alpha of 128:
