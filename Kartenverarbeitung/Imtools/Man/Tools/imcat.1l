NAME
     imcat  -  Concatenates multiple image files  into  a  single
     image file

SYNOPSIS
     imcat [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s... -outfile _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imcat reads in each input image  file,  collects  the  image
     data  from  each,  and  writes the entire set to the single,
     multi-image output file.  The  resulting  output  file  will
     contain  a  concatenation  of  the data found in each of the
     individual input files.

     The input and output image file formats  may  be  different.
     The  output file format must support the storage of multiple
     images in a single file.

OPTIONS
     imcat has  a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options for all SDSC tools

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Input File Names
     Input file names may be given explicitly or implicitly.   In
     an explicit list, the user gives each image file name on the
     command-line for imcat.  The following are  typical  invoca-
     tions of imcat using explicit file names:

          imcat thing1.rgb thing2.hdf sam.ras i.pix. am.rla -out-
          file outputgroup.hdf
          imcat credits0.rgb credits1.rgb  credits2.rgb  -outfile
          outcredits.tiff
          imcat icons*.ico -outfile myicons.hdf

     File names may be given implicitly by providing a file  name
     template that contains the special character code "%d", like
     the C language printf(3) print format directive.  This  tem-
     plate  will be used to generate a series of image file names
     by replacing the "%d" with integer frame numbers, one  after
     another.   The  template myimage.%d.rgb, for instance, could

     generate  the  file  names   myimage.0.rgb,   myimage.1.rgb,
     myimage.2.rgb, and so on.

     The range of integer frame numbers used  to  generate  input
     file  names from a template is given using the -frames _r_a_n_g_e
     option, where the _r_a_n_g_e is  a  single  value,  or  range  of
     values, taking one of the following forms:

          _r_a_n_g_e   Generate file names with frame numbers of
8          _________________________________________________
          _n       _n only (single value).
          _n-_m     _n through _m (range of values).

     There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  Also, _n  need
     not be a value less than _m.

     The following are typical  invocations  of  imcat  using  an
     implicit file name template and -frames:

          imcat    credits%d.rgb     -frames     0-2     -outfile
          outcredits.tiff
          imcat    -frames    0-200    movie.%03d.ras    -outfile
          collection.hdf
          imcat    -frames    200-0    movie.%03d.ras    -outfile
          reversed.hdf

     Implicit and explicit file naming may  be  combined  on  the
     same command-line, such as:

          imcat   title.rgb    -frames    0-100    movie.%03d.rgb
          credit1.rgb copyright.rgb -outfile output.hdf

     -frames can only be given once.  If more than  one  implicit
     file  name  template  is used on the same command-line, each
     use will use the same frame number range.

     Image files are read in and placed into the output  file  in
     the order in which they appear on the command-line.

NOTES
     Multi-image files created by imcat may be split into  multi-
     ple single-image files by imsplit(1IM).

     Most image file formats cannot support the storage of multi-
     ple  images  in  the same file.  This is a limitation of the
     file format design, not imcat.  imcat will  issue  an  error
     message  if  the  selected output file format cannot support
     the storage of multiple images in a single file.

     imformats(1IM) may be used to display a  list  of  supported
     file  formats  and  their  attributes.   Use  -long -long on
     imformats(1IM) to display extensive format information  that
     indicates which file formats support multiple image storage.

IMCAT(1IM)                 IMAGE TOOLS                 IMCAT(1IM)



     Implicit file naming is most useful when concatenating  mul-
     tiple  images from an animation into a single, large, multi-
     image file.  In such  cases,  the  image  files  being  con-
     catenated usually include a frame number in the file name.

     imcat uses the C language sprintf(3) routine to replace  the
     file  name  template's  "%d"  with  successive  image  frame
     numbers.  The use of sprintf(3) means the full range of "%d"
     format  directive  syntax  is  available in generating input
     file names.  While the sprintf(3) man page has full  details
     on  the  "%d" print directive, the following is a summary as
     it applies to input file naming:

          The "%d" directive has the following general syntax:

                "%" [_f_l_a_g_s] [_d_i_g_i_t] ["." _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n] "d"

          The directive always starts with a  "%"  character  and
          ends with a "d" character.  Field names between [ ]s in
          the syntax above are optional.  With no optional  field
          value, the simplest form of the directive is just "%d".

          _f_l_a_g_s
               Following the "%" is  an  optional  set  of  _f_l_a_g_s
               characters:

                    _f_l_a_g      Meaning
8                    ___________________________________________________________
                    -         Left justify the frame number.  Default is right.
                    +         Include the sign (+ or -).  Default is just -.
                    (blank)   Use a blank instead of a + for positive numbers.

               Except for peculiar file naming,  users  of  imcat
               can  omit  the  optional  _f_l_a_g_s portion of a print
               directive.

          _d_i_g_i_t
               Following the _f_l_a_g_s field  is  an  optional  _d_i_g_i_t
               field that gives the field width of the number, in
               characters.  If the  number  requires  fewer  than
               this  minimum,  it  will be padded on the right or
               left with blanks (padding is controlled by  the  -
               _f_l_a_g  above).   If  the  number requires more than
               this minimum, it will be taken.
               _ The _d_i_g_i_t field can be preceded by a 0 (zero) to
               cause  padding  to  be  done  with  leading zeroes
               instead of blanks.  This is useful when  referring
               to  frame numbers of the form "001," "002," "003,"
               and so on.

          _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n
               The _d_i_g_i_t field may be optionally  followed  by  a
               "." (period) and a _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n number that gives the

               minimum number of digits  for  the  frame  number.
               This  isn't particularly useful for users of imcat
               and can be skipped.

          The following are a few typical "%d" directives for use
          in imcat:

               Directive   Use in imcat
               %d          No leading zeros or blanks.  Generates numbers like "0," "1," "2," "3," etc.
               %03d        Leading zeros to fill 3 characters, including the number.  Generates numbers like "000," "001," "002," "003," etc.
               %.3d        Same effect as "%03d"

     In order to concatenate the image data, imcat reads in every
     input image file first, before writing any of it to the out-
     put file.  This can take up quite a bit of memory.   If  the
     host  does not have enough memory and swap space, imcat will
     fail with a memory allocation error.

     In general, tar(1) is a better  way  of  maintaining  multi-
     image  files than using imcat.  Multi-image files created by
     tar(1) can be extracted one image at a time, or in any  com-
     bination,  and retain the original image file names.  Multi-
     image files created by imcat can only be  extracted  all  at
     once,  such  as by using imsplit(1IM), and cannot retain the
     original file names due to limitations in the  output  image
     file formats.

     tar(1) and imcat multi-image files  occupy  about  the  same
     amount  of disk space and take about the same amount of time
     to be created or split apart.  However, the format of tar(1)
     files  is a fairly universal standard, whereas the few image
     file formats supporting storage of multiple  images  in  one
     file (such as HDF) are less universal.

     imcat is only provided for  the  relatively  few  situations
     where users need to build multi-image files for use in other
     existing applications.  For simple storage and data  manage-
     ment purposes, tar(1) is a more appropriate tool.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.
