NAME
     imlighten  -  Lighten or darken an image

SYNOPSIS
     imlighten [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imlighten lightens or darkens an image  by  multiplying  the
     intensity of each pixel by a scalar.

OPTIONS
     imlighten has a variety of options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     -factor _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_i_e_r species the scalar  by  which  we  should
     multiply the intensities.

NOTES
     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To make a Sun Rasterfile 50% darker use the following:

          imlighten light.ras darker.ras -factor 0.5

     To make a TIFF 80% lighter, use the following:

          imlighten toodark.tiff brighter.tiff -factor 1.8

     See the individual file format man pages for the authors  of
     the  underlying  format  read  and write code.  The names of
     these man pages begin with the letters "im" followed by  the
     format  name.  For example, the name of the TIFF man page is
     imtiff.  To display it, enter man imtiff.
