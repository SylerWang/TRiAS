NAME
     imfill  -  fills pixels in part or all of an image

SYNOPSIS
     imfill [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imfill fills an area of each image in the input file with  a
     color  or  alpha  value and stores the results to the output
     file.  The input and output image file formats may  be  dif-
     ferent.

     If no input file is  given,  imfill  creates  a  new  image,
     filled  as  directed,  and  stores  the result in the output
     file.

OPTIONS
     imfill has a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Filling            How the image will be filled

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Filling Options
     The region of the input image to be filled is defined by six
     arguments:

          -xposition _x   Left edge of region
          -yposition _y   Top edge of position
          -xsize _w       Width of region
          -ysize _h       Height of region
          -inside        Fill the inside of the region (default)
          -outside       Fill the outside of the region

     -xposition and -yposition specify the fill  region  position
     and  are  constrained  to  be within the bounds of the input
     image. Both -xposition and -yposition default to a value  of
     0, where (0,0) is the upper-left corner of the image.

     -xsize and -ysize give the size of the fill region  and  are
     constrained to fit within the bounds of the input image.  If
     these options are not given, the fill region defaults  to  a

     rectangle  whose  upper  left  corner  is  at the given fill
     region position, and which extends to the right  and  bottom
     edges of the input image.

     -inside and -outside select whether pixels inside or outside
     the  fill  region  are to be filled.  -inside is the default
     and causes the specified rectangular area of the image to be
     filled.   Pixels  outside  of  this area are copied from the
     input image to the output image.  -outside instead fills the
     area  outside of the fill rectangle.  Pixels inside the fill
     area are copied from the input image to the output image.

     Fill values are selected using one or more of the  following
     fill options:

     Multiple fill options may be given, as long as color  spaces
     are  not  mixed.   For  instance,  -index  for filling color
     indexes is incompatible with -red for filling the  red  com-
     ponent  of  RGB triplets.  Likewise, -hue for filling pixels
     based upon an HSI color space hue value is incompatible with
     -blue for filling with blue in the RGB color space.  See the
     imintro(3IM) man page for a description of the RGB  and  HSI
     color spaces.

     If imfill is directed to fill  the  alpha  component  of  an
     image  that does not have an alpha channel, an alpha channel
     is created and initialized to 0s (transparent).

     If imfill is directed to fill a pixel  component  that  does
     not exist in the input image (except for alpha), an error is
     reported.

     Input image components not selected for filling  by  a  fill
     option  are  copied  to  the  output  image  untouched.  For
     instance, an image's alpha plane may be initialized  to  255
     (opaque)  without affecting RGB or color index components of
     pixels.  Likewise, an image's RGB red channel may be  filled
     without its green and blue components being affected.

     Each of the fill options can accept  an  argument  giving  a
     single  value, or range of values with which to fill.  Value
     _r_a_n_g_e syntax takes any one of the following forms:

          _r_a_n_g_e   Fill with values of
8          ____________________________________________________________
          _n       _n only.
          _n-      _n through the maximum legal value for the component.
          _n-_m     _n through _m.

     There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  _n need not be
     a value less than _m.

     When filling with a single value, the entire fill region  is
     set to the same value.

     When a range of fill values are given, such as -red 0-255 or
     -intensity  0.6-0.2,  the  fill region will be filled with a
     gradation, or ramp, as selected by  the  -graduate  option's
     argument:

          option                 Meaning
8          ____________________________________________________________
          -graduate none         Fill with a constant value
          -graduate horizontal   Fill with a horizontal ramp (default)
          -graduate vertical     Fill with a vertical ramp

     none, horizontal, and vertical may each  be  abbreviated  to
     the fewest unique letters.

     The horizontal ramp for a graduated  fill  starts  from  the
     first  fill value at the left edge of the fill area and goes
     to the second fill value at the right  edge.   The  vertical
     ramp  for a graduated fill goes from the first fill value at
     the top edge of the fill area to the second  fill  value  at
     the bottom edge.

NOTES
     Error messages are reported to stderr.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page for imconv(1IM).

     If the output file format cannot support the storage  of  an
     alpha  channel  (many  cannot), any alpha channel created or
     filled by imfill will be silently discarded when the  output
     file is written. imformats(1IM) may be used to review a list
     of file format attributes in order to choose an  image  file
     format that supports alpha channel storage.

     With no fill options, the actions of imfill default  to  the
     same  as  the SDSC image format conversion tool imconv(1IM),
     but they take a little longer.

     imfill is useful for filling rectangular areas of images  to
     a  constant or ramped color.  To change only selected pixels
     of an image, such as all black pixels, or  all  pixels  with
     saturation  values  over 0.8, use the pixel value adjustment
     tool imadjust(1IM).

     Different pixel components have  different  types  and  dif-
     ferent minimum and maximum values.

EXAMPLES
     Create a 640 x 480 RGB Sun raster file filled with black:

          imfill -xsize 640 -ysize 480 -red 0 -green  0  -blue  0
          rgbblack.ras

     Add an alpha channel to an Alias PIX image, initialize it to
     255s, and save it to an HDF file:

          imfill image.pix -alpha 255 image_alpha.hdf

     Fill a rectangle in a Sun raster file with white, and  store
     the result as a Silicon Graphics RGB file:

          imfill map.ras mapwhite.rgb -xposition 50 -yposition 50
          -xsize 50 -ysize 50 -red 255 -blue 255 -green 255

     Fill outside the rectangle instead of inside it:

          imfill map.ras mapwhite.rgb -xposition 50 -yposition 50
          -xsize 50 -ysize 50 -red 255 -blue 255 -green 255 -out-
          side

     Create a new image with a horizontal ramp shading from  blue
     to red:

          imfill -xsize 200 -ysize 200 -red 20-120  -blue  150-50
          purple.rgb

     Create a new image with a vertical ramp  shading  from  dark
     grey to light grey:

          imfill -xsize 200 -ysize 200 -intensity .2-.6 -graduate
          vertical grey.rgb

     Fill an image with  a  ramp  in  hue,  while  leaving  pixel
     saturation  and  intensity  the  same  (this  creates a neat
     effect!):

          imfill face.rgb -hue 0.0-360.0 colorface.rgb

     Fill a portion of a color indexed Sun raster file image with
     index  values of 0 (often set to black), and save the result
     as an RGB Sun raster file:

          imfill -xpos 10 -ypos 20 -xsize 100 -ysize 12 -index  0
          -outrgb in.ras out.ras

     Fill a Silicon Graphics RGB image file with a ramp in green,
     then save the image as a color index Sun raster file:

          imfill    rgbimage.rgb    -green    0-255     -outindex
          indeximage.ras
