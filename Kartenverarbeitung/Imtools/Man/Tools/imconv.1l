NAME
     imconv  -  Convert between image file formats

SYNOPSIS
     imconv [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     With no recognized  standard,  most  commercially  available
     image-handling  applications use their own custom image file
     format to store pixel data.  To use imagery generated by one
     application as input into another is complicated by the need
     to convert from one custom file format to another.

     The SDSC image tools are tools developed at  the  San  Diego
     Supercomputer Center (SDSC) to handle image manipulation and
     file format conversion for a wide range of file formats.

     imconv converts an input image file with one  format  to  an
     output  image  file  with  a different format.  If the input
     file contains multiple images, so will the output  file,  if
     its format can support it.

OPTIONS
     imconv has  a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  six
     categories:

          File Selection     Which input and output file to use
          File Compression   How the input and output file are compressed
          Format Selection   Which format to use for the input and output file
          Format Control     Which variant of format to use for the output file
          Miscellaneous      Other methods of altering the input or output file
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools

     These categories are discussed separately below.

     Any option which affects the input file begins with the pre-
     fix  "-in".  Any option which affects the output file begins
     with the prefix "-out".

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  File Selection Options
     imconv needs to know where to  read  image  information  and
     where  to  write  it.  So, in its simplest form, it requires
     only the input and output filenames as follows:

          imconv picture.pix newpic.ras

     imconv assumes the first filename is the input file and  the
     second the output file.

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     You may optionally precede the input and output filenames by
     -infile, and -outfile, respectively.  For instance:

          imconv -infile picture.pix -outfile newpic.ras

     To direct imconv to read from stdin or write to stdout,  use
     a filename consisting of a single dash (-).

          imconv -informat pix - newpic.ras < picture.pix
              or
          imconv picture.pix -outformat ras - > newpic.ras
              or
          imconv -informat pix - -outformat ras - < picture.pix > newpic.ras
              or
          cat picture.pix | imconv -informat pix - -outformat ras - | cat > newpic.ras

     When reading from stdin or writing to stdout, you must indi-
     cate  the  format  of the image file explicitly with options
     like -informat pix and -outformat ras above.  These  options
     are  discussed in more detail in the "Format Selection" sec-
     tion.

  File Compression Options
     Because image files tend to get quite  large,  it  is  often
     desirable  to  compress them with a compression program such
     as compress or gzip.  imconv is capable of both  compressing
     and decompressing files via the following schemes:

          Suffix   External Program   Scheme Name
8          ___________________________________________________
          Z        compress           Lempel-Ziv Encoding
          gz       gzip               Gnu Lempel-Ziv Encoding
          z        pack               Huffman Encoding
          uu       uuencode           ASCII encoding

     The list above may be  incomplete.   For  a  complete  list,
     please type:
          imconv -help -infilecompress

     If you would like to output a compressed file, there are two
     ways to do it.  The first way is simply to put the suffix of
     the compression scheme on the end  of  your  filename.   The
     second way is to use the -outfilecompression flag.  That is,
                imconv infile.gif outfile.ras.Z
                imconv infile.gif outfile.ras.Z  -outfilecompres-
          sion Z
     will both produce  a  Sun  Rasterfile  which  is  Lempel-Ziv
     Encoded.

     If the output is stdout, (i.e. the filename is '-') then the
     latter method must be used.

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     When reading a compressed file, there  are  three  ways  for
     imconv to know that the incoming file is compressed.  imconv
     attempts to uncompress a file if: 1. the  -infilecompression
     option is used, 2. the file has a magic number corresponding
     to the magic number for a  compression  scheme,  or  3.  The
     filename  suffix  matches  one  of  the suffixes in the list
     above.

     That is,
                imconv infile.gif.uu outfile.ras
                imconv   infile.gif.uu    -infilecompression    Z
          outfile.ras
     will both attempt to read a uuencoded GIF and store it as  a
     Sun Rasterfile.

     If the input is stdin, (i.e. the filename is '-'), then  the
     -infilecompression option must be used.

     The Image Tools will search for the external programs  named
     above when doing compression or decompression, by looking in
     the  environment  PATH  variable.   For  information   about
     installing  your own compression schemes or specifying paths
     for certain executables, please refer to the source code  in
     the file imschemes.c, or the installation documentation.

  Format Selection Options
     imconv supports a wide variety of file formats.  For a  com-
     plete  list  of formats please use the imformats command, or
     refer to the man page, imintro (3IM).

     For imconv to read or write an  image  file,  it  must  know
     which format it is reading or writing. In most cases, imconv
     can determine your intent by looking at the input and output
     filenames.  For instance:

          imconv picture.pix mypic.ras

     To determine the format of picture.pix, imconv opens it  and
     looks  at  the first few bytes of the file.  It checks these
     against a list of "magic numbers"  for  various  image  file
     formats.  If it finds no match, imconv extracts the filename
     suffix (.pix from picture.pix) and  compares  it  against  a
     list of known suffixes for supported image file formats.

     To  determine  the  format  to  use  for  mypic.ras,  imconv
     extracts  the  output  filename suffix (.ras from mypic.ras)
     and compares it against a list  of  suffixes  for  supported
     image file formats.

     If imconv cannot discern what format to use,  it  issues  an
     error message and exits.

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     Thus, in the above example, we would read an Alias PIX  file
     and write a Sun Rasterfile.

     On occasion it is necessary to override imconv's file format
     assumptions.   To do so, you must specify an explicit format
     option preceding an input or output filename.  For instance:

          imconv  -informat  pix   picture.pix   -outformat   ras
          mypic.ras


     This is required when  reading  from  stdin  or  writing  to
     stdout.  In either case imconv has no filename from which to
     extract a filename suffix  and,  therefore,  cannot  discern
     what format to use.

     As mentioned above, a  complete  list  of  file  formats  is
     available  via  the  imformats command.  To obtain extensive
     information about each format, use imformats with the  -long
     option, as follows:

          imformats -long

     You may also obtain a list  of  formats  by  using  imconv's
     flag-specific help (described below).  Simply type:

          imconv -help -informat


  Format Control Options
     Virtually all image file  formats  have  multiple  variants.
     These   variants  have  different  image  depths,  different
     compression schemes, different RGB image interleave methods,
     inclusion  or  exclusion  of  color lookup tables (CLTs) and
     alpha planes, and so on.  In most  cases  imconv  picks  the
     correct  variant  to use when writing the output file.  How-
     ever, in some  cases  you  may  wish  to  override  imconv's
     defaults and select a variant explicitly using the following
     format control options:

     -outindex
     -outrgb

     Output to color index or RGB image, respectively.

     Typically, image  pixels  are  represented  as  color  index
     (pseudo-color) or RGB (true-color) values.

     A color index is a small integer  (usually  8-  or  12-bits)
     that  indexes into an associated color lookup table (CLT) to
     get the red-green-blue (RGB) color value for a pixel in  the
     image.   A  color  index  image  is  often  refered  to as a

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     "pseudo-color" image because the color for a given pixel  is
     found in the CLT, not in the pixel data itself.

     An RGB image stores the red-green-blue  (RGB)  value  for  a
     pixel's  color  for  every  pixel in the image.  There is no
     associated CLT.  RGB images are often refered to  as  "true-
     color"  because  the  full  color description (RGB value) is
     stored in each pixel.

     -outindex forces imconv to convert the incoming image  to  a
     color  index image before writing it to the output file.  If
     the output file format cannot support storing a color  index
     image, then imconv reports an error and exits.

     -outrgb forces imconv to convert the incoming  image  to  an
     RGB image before writing it to the output file.  If the out-
     put file format cannot support storing an  RGB  image,  then
     imconv reports an error and exits.

     By default, if the input  file's  image  is  a  color  index
     image,  imconv tries to write it out as a color index image.
     Similarly, if the input file's image is an RGB image, imconv
     tries to write it out as an RGB image.  If the output format
     doesn't support what imconv wants, imconv automatically con-
     verts  the  image to one of the supported output file format
     variants.

     -outchandepth _n_b_i_t_s

     Specify output depth.

     Some file formats allow color indexes and RGB values  to  be
     stored  with a specific number of "bits-per-channel".  While
     8 bits-per-channel is by far the most common,  some  formats
     support 1, 4, 12, 16, 24, and 32 bits-per-channel.

     A color index image has 1 channel (the index into the  color
     lookup  table); an RGB image has 3 channels (red, green, and
     blue).  The channel depth is the number  of  bits  _f_o_r  _e_a_c_h
     _c_h_a_n_n_e_l.  So, an RGB image with an 8-bit channel depth takes
     3 * 8 = 24 bits per pixel.  An RGB image with a 24-bit chan-
     nel depth takes 3 * 24 = 72 bits per pixel.

     The _n_b_i_t_s argument to the -outchandepth  is  the  number  of
     bits  to use per channel when writing out the image.  If the
     output file format cannot support the  number  of  bits  per
     channel you specify, imconv reports an error and exits.

     By default, imconv chooses the  best  number  based  on  the
     number  of  bits per channel used by the incoming image.  If
     an input file's image uses  a  16-bit  color  index,  imconv
     tries  to  output  the  image using a 16-bit, or more, color

     index.  Truncation occurs only if the output  format  cannot
     support  the incoming image's number of bits per channel, or
     anything larger.  In  fact,  in  the  case  of  color  index
     images, if imconv is given the choice of truncating a 16-bit
     color index image to 8 bits or converting it to RGB for  the
     same  output  format,  imconv  converts  it  to RGB.  imconv
     always chooses the path with the least  degradation  of  the
     data.

     -outnchan _n_c_h_a_n

     Select number of output channels.

     The number of channels in an image is the number  of  values
     stored  per  pixel.   A color index image has 1 channel (the
     color index into the color lookup table). An RGB image has 3
     channels  (red,  green,  and  blue).  Though channel numbers
     other than 1 or 3 are  possible,  in  practice  they  aren't
     used.  (We don't count the alpha channel.)

     The _n_c_h_a_n argument  to  the  -outnchan  option  selects  the
     number  of channels per pixel (not including the alpha chan-
     nel) to use when writing the image.

     This option is provided as a path towards future functional-
     ity.   In the present release, this option provides the same
     information as the -outindex and -outrgb options.

     -outclt
     -outnoclt

     Do or don't output a color lookup table (CLT).

     Color index images usually have a CLT associated with  them.
     RGB images can also have them, though less commonly.

     Some image file formats allow the CLT to be left out of  the
     image  file.   The  -outnoclt  option  directs imconv to not
     write the CLT.  The -outclt option directs imconv  to  write
     the CLT.

     Some formats require the CLT to be included in the file.  In
     such  cases,  if  you  specify  the -outnoclt option, imconv
     reports an error and exits, since it  is  unable  to  comply
     with your request.

     In much rarer cases, some formats do not allow a CLT  to  be
     stored  in  the  image  file.   If  you  specify the -outclt
     option, imconv reports an error and exits.

     If the incoming image does not have a CLT  but  you  specify
     -outclt, imconv writes a ramping CLT (low to high).  This is

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     most common when reading in a grayscale image  (color  index
     image  without  a  CLT) and writing out a color image (color
     index image with a gray ramp for a CLT).

     By default, if the incoming image has a CLT, imconv attempts
     to  store  it.   If the output format cannot store a CLT but
     can store an RGB  image,  imconv  automatically  converts  a
     color index image to an RGB image and stores it that way.

     -outalpha
     -outnoalpha

     Do or don't output an alpha channel.

     An alpha channel contains a coverage value  for  each  image
     pixel  and  typically  is used when compositing images.  For
     instance, to make image ABC partially cover  XYZ,  parts  of
     ABC are marked as opaque (they cover XYZ), while other parts
     are transparent (XYZ shows through).

     Alpha values typically range from 0 to 255.  0  means  tran-
     sparent,  255 opaque. Values between 0 and 255 indicate par-
     tial transparency and direct compositing software to mix the
     color of the image on top with the color of the image below,
     using the alpha value as a weighting factor.

     -outalpha directs that an alpha channel be  output  for  the
     image.   If  -outalpha is given and the output format cannot
     support an alpha channel (most cannot),  imconv  reports  an
     error and exits.

     -outnoalpha directs that an alpha channel not be output.  If
     -outnoalpha  is  given  and  the  output format must have an
     alpha channel (rare), imconv reports an error and exits.

     If the incoming image does not have an alpha channel but you
     specify  -outalpha, imconv automatically generates an opaque
     alpha channel (all 255s).

     By default, if the incoming  image  has  an  alpha  channel,
     imconv  tries  to write it out.  For some file formats, only
     RGB images, not color index images, can be stored with alpha
     channels.  In  such  cases, if the incoming image is a color
     index image with an alpha channel, imconv automatically con-
     verts the image to RGB to preserve the alpha channel.

     -outinterleave _m_e_t_h_o_d

     Specify interleave method.

     This option only applies to RGB images.

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     RGB images are written out using one of the following  three
     methods:

          noninterleaved         RGBRGBRGBRGB...
          scanline-interleaved   RR..GG..BB..RR..GG..BB...
          plane-interleaved      RRRR..GGGG..BBB..

     Some formats support all three methods.  Other formats  sup-
     port  only  one or two.  The -outinterleave option takes one
     of the following arguments:

          none    noninterleaved
          line    scanline-interleaved
          plane   plane-interleaved

     If the output format does not support the interleave  method
     you select, imconv reports an error and exits.

     By default, imconv chooses the most efficient or most widely
     used interleave method for the output format.  In most cases
     imconv chooses plane-interleaved over  scanline-interleaved,
     and   scanline-interleaved  over  noninterleaved.   This  is
     because image compression schemes (see below) work better on
     plane-  and  scanline-interleaved  images, thus reducing the
     amount of disk space an image file requires.

     -outcompress _s_c_h_e_m_e

     Specify compression scheme.

     Most image  file  formats  support  compression  schemes  to
     reduce the size of a file.  Some formats even support multi-
     ple compression schemes.

     The single argument to the -outcompress option is  the  name
     of the compression scheme to use:

          none                noncompressed
          lzw                 Limpel-Ziv & Welsh compressed
          pb, packbits, mac   Apple Macintosh Packbits
          rle                 Run-Length-Encoded

     Noncompressed images store each image pixel as  a  value  or
     values  in  the  file.   No tricks are applied to reduce the
     disk space requirements.   Noncompressed  image  files  take
     longer  to  write out and read in, and they use up more disk
     space (often several  times  as  much  as  a  wellcompressed
     image).

     Compression schemes  use  trickery  to  reduce  the  storage
     requirements  of  the image.  The most common among these is
     Run-Length Encoding (RLE).  RLE is based on  the  fact  that

     most  images have runs of adjacent pixels of the same color,
     such as solid color image backgrounds.  These  runs  can  be
     abbreviated  to  just a count of the number of pixels in the
     run, and the color to use for  the  run.   Runlength-encoded
     images usually take 30-50% less disk space.

     Most image formats support some variant of RLE  compression.
     Since  these variants are similar, imconv refers to them all
     as "rle compression."

     Limpel-Ziv & Welsh and Apple's Packbits compression are fan-
     cier and too complex to explain here.

     If the output format does not support the form  of  compres-
     sion you select with the -outcompress option, imconv reports
     an error and exits.

     By default, imconv chooses the most efficient or most widely
     used compression scheme supported by the output file format.

     Most image file formats only support a subset of  the  func-
     tionality  represented  by imconv's options.  In rare cases,
     the format may support the functionality,  but  imconv  does
     not.   For a list of what is supported, enter imformats(1IM)
     with the -long option, as follows:

          imformats -long

     For greater detail, you may specify the -long option  twice,
     as follows:

          imformats -long -long

  Miscellaneous Options
     Following are a list of options which affect how a  file  is
     read  or  how  a  file is written.  Options which begin with
     "-in" affect reading of a file.  Options  which  begin  with
     "-out" affect writing of a file.

          -inmap channel_map
               The -inmap option allows you to permute the  chan-
               nels   of   an   image  when  reading  it  in.   A
               channel_map is  of  the  form  <channel>=<channel>
               where <channel> is one of the following:
                    red,  green,  blue,   alpha,   grey,   index,
                    index16, none
               This option will take a channel from the image and
               map it to a different channel in memory.  Here are
               some examples of how to use the -inmap option:

               Given an image with red, green, blue,  and  alpha,
               create a new image such that: the alpha of the new

               image is the green of the original,  the  blue  of
               the  new  image  is the green of the original, the
               red of the new image is the alpha of the original,
               and there is no green in the new image:
                    imconv   picture.rgb   permuted.rgb    -inmap
                    alpha=green    -inmap    blue=green    -inmap
                    red=alpha -inmap green=none
               Given a greyscale picture, make an image which  is
               red instead of grey:
                    imconv greyscale.ras red.rgb -inmap  red=grey
                    -inmap blue=none -inmap green=none
               Only read in the blue channel  of  an  image,  and
               ignore the red and green channels:
                    imconv  colors.rgb  -inmap  red=none   -inmap
                    green=none justblue.rgb
               To perform more specific options on components  of
               pixels, you may use the imadjust command.

          -outmap channel_map
               The -outmap option allows you to permute the chan-
               nels   of   an  image  when  writing  it  out.   A
               channel_map is  of  the  form  <channel>=<channel>
               where <channel> is one of the following:
                    red,  green,  blue,   alpha,   grey,   index,
                    index16, none
               This option will take a channel from the image  in
               memory  and  map  it to a different channel in the
               output file.

               For instance, to create  a  greyscale  file  whose
               grey  values  correspond  to  the  alpha values of
               another file type:
                    imconv i_have_alpha.rgb greyscale.ras -outmap
                    grey=alpha
               To perform more specific options on components  of
               pixels, you may use the imadjust command.

          -outtransparencyrgb red green blue
          -outtransparencyindex index
          -outtransparency
               These  options  affect  certain  types  of   color
               indexed  images,  such  as GIF and XPM.  The tran-
               sparency value of an image is an  index  into  the
               color  lookup  table which corresponds to a "tran-
               sparent" color.  For instance, XPM files are  used
               as  icons.   By  giving  a transparency value, the
               background will show through  wherever  there  are
               pixels  with  this value.  When Mosaic or Netscape
               displays a GIF, the background will similarly show
               through wherever the transparency pixel occurs.

               The -outtransparency  option  indicates  that  the

               most  popular  color  in  the  image should be the
               transparency.  The -outtransparencyrgb flag  indi-
               cates  that  pixels with the given red, green, and
               blue values should be transparent.  The  -outtran-
               sparencyindex  flag indicates that pixels with the
               given index value should be transparent.

          -inpagewidth
          -inpageheight
          -indpi
               These options are used for formats  that  have  no
               predefined  width and height.  Since the only such
               format supported by  the  SDSC  Image  Library  is
               Postscript,  please  refer  to  the man page, imps
               (3IM) for a description of these options.

          -outgroup grouping_method
               Some file formats (such as TIFF  and  JPEG)  allow
               grouping  of  pixels  by tiles instead of by scan-
               lines.  That is, normally the pixels in  an  image
               are stored in the form: row 1, row 2, row 3, etc..
               However, certain compression schemes  prefer  that
               that the pixels be grouped into rectangular tiles.
               Then pixels are stored in the form: tile  1,  tile
               2, tile 3, etc...

               By using the -outgroup scanlines option, you indi-
               cate  the former method of storage.  The -outgroup
               tiles option indicates the latter.

          -outquality value
               This option affects the quality of compression for
               certain  compression  schemes.   There  is often a
               tradeoff between the amount of compression and the
               quality  of  the  resulting  image.  (And also the
               amound of time it takes to decompress or  compress
               an  image.)   By  specifying  a high value for the
               quality, you indicate that you'd like the  quality
               to be preserved.  If you choose to make your image
               higher quality then the image will  probably  take
               up more disk space.  The only format that supports
               the -outquality option is JPEG.

          options, then specific help will be given for the other
          options.  For instance,
               imconv -help -inmap
          will give help about the -inmap option.

     -register
          Create a software user registration form  in  the  file
          imconv.reg.0.

     -verbose
          Display progress messages to stdout during  the  course
          of the image file conversion.

     -version
          Display the version number and copyright for imconv.

NOTES
     Error messages are reported to stderr.

     The conversions take varying lengths of time depending  upon
     the  complexity of the input and output file formats and the
     complexity of the image itself.

     Some file formats create a temporary file in  /usr/tmp  when
     reading from stdin or writing to stdout.

     Some file formats, such as PostScript, cannot  be  used  for
     input.

     Typically, you don't need to use the various channel  depth,
     interleave  method,  and compression scheme options.  imconv
     does a good job of figuring out how to get the input  file's
     image  stored  into  the  output file with a minimum loss of
     information, if any at all.  If anything, imconv  is  overly
     zealous  about  avoiding loss of information.  Consider this
     scenario: An input file contains a color index image with  a
     CLT.   The  selected output format supports both color index
     (with or without CLT) and RGB images.  The user  enters  the
     following command line:

          imconv input.ras -outnoclt output.hdf

     What type of image is stored in output.hdf?  The answer:  An
     RGB  image, even though the incoming image was a color index
     image!

IMCONV(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMCONV(1IM)



     The intent of the user typing in the above command might  be
     to  strip off the CLT and write the color index image to the
     output  file.   However,  imconv  interprets  the  -outnoclt
     option  literally.  -outnoclt means a CLT should not be out-
     put.  But it gives no information  about  how  image  pixels
     should  be stored.  To avoid loss of information yet satisfy
     the user's request, imconv's only recourse is to convert the
     image to RGB.

     To strip off the CLT but preserve the image as a color index
     image, enter the following command line instead:

          imconv input.ras -outindex -outnoclt output.hdf

KNOWN PROBLEMS
     Different formats use different  terminology.   imconv  uses
     generic  terminology.   If you're only familiar with format-
     specific terms, you may find imconv confusing.

     imconv supports selection of only the  most  common  format-
     specific  variants.   For instance, you can't select how GIF
     8-bit color index images should be  interlaced  when  stored
     (not the same as RGB interleaving).

     When an input file has multiple images in it (such  as  HDF,
     GIF,  or  TIFF files), the output file format must also sup-
     port multiple images per  file.   SDSC  plans  to  implement
     tools  in  the  near  future to create and split multi-image
     files.
