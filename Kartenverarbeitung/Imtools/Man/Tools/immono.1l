NAME
     immono  -  Convert an image to monochrome

SYNOPSIS
     immono [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     immono converts an input image to monochrome, then writes it
     to  an output image file.  If the input file contains multi-
     ple images, immono converts each one and writes  it  to  the
     output file.  The input and output image file formats may be
     different.

OPTIONS
     immono has a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     Conversion of an input image to  monochrome  is  a  two-step
     process:

          1.   Convert the color image to grayscale.
          2.   Convert the grayscale image to monochrome.

     In step 1, conversion from color to grayscale  computes  the
     gray value for each pixel using the NTSC Y equation:

               Gray ~~=~~ 0.30*R ~+~ 0.59*G ~+~ 0.11*B

     In step 2 conversion from grayscale pixel values (0-255)  to
     monochrome  pixel  values  (0  or 1) can use either a simple
     thresholding technique or it can use dithering.  The default
     is  the  former;  pixel  values  equal to or higher than the
     threshold are considered  white.   Pixel  values  below  the
     threshold are considered black.

     By default, the threshold is set at 127.  This threshold may
     be  selected explicitly using -threshold followed by a posi-
     tive integer.

     If dithering is desired, then step 2 is different.  By  giv-
     ing  the -dither option, dithering will be used.  Dithering,
     in this case, is a mechanism for arranging black  and  white
     pixels  in  various patterns in order to give the appearance
     of different shades of grey.  (More generally, dithering  is
     the process by which many colors can be represented by fewer
     colors.)

     immono uses Floyd-Steinberg dithering.  The  Floyd-Steinberg
     algorithm works like this:  The image is traversed from left
     to right and top to bottom.  If a given pixel has a value of
     255  or  greater, then this pixel will be set to white (i.e.
     255), and the difference (i.e. the pixel  value  minus  255)
     will  be  propagated  to  the neighboring pixels as follows:
     Seven sixteenths of the error goes to the right, three  six-
     teenths  to  the bottom-left, five-sixteenths to the bottom,
     and one-sixteenth to the bottom-right.

          ----   xx     7/16
          3/16   5/16   1/16

     If the value of the pixel is less than 255, then  the  value
     of  the  pixel  will  be  propogated in the manner described
     above, and the pixel will be set to black.  (i.e. 0)

     The idea behind Floyd-Steinberg dithering is  to  allow  the
     image  to  be dithered with a single top-to-bottom, left-to-
     right pass.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To convert an RGB Alias pix file  image  to  monochrome  and
     store  it in a Sun ras file, enter any of the following com-
     mand lines:

          immono picture.pix picture.ras
              or
          immono -informat pix picture.pix -outformat ras picture.ras
              or
          immono -informat pix - picture.ras < picture.pix
              or
          immono -informat pix picture.pix -outformat ras - > picture.ras
              or
          immono -informat pix - -outformat ras - < picture.pix > picture.ras
              or
          cat picture.pix | immono -informat pix - -outformat ras - | cat > picture.ras

     See the individual file format man pages for the authors  of
     the  underlying  format  read  and write code.  The names of
     these man pages begin with the letters "im" followed by  the
     format  name.  For example, the name of the TIFF man page is
