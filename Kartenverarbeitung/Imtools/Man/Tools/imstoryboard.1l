NAME
     imstoryboard  -  Paste images together to  create  a  story-
     board

SYNOPSIS
     imstoryboard [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s -outfile _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imstoryboard pastes images in a storyboard, or grid, on  top
     of  a background image.  The result is stored in a new file.
     Storyboard options to  control  grid  margin,  gutter,  row,
     column,  and  other  features  are  available.  imstoryboard
     chooses default values  to  try  to  produce  square  output
     images.

     The input, background, and output image file formats may  be
     different.

OPTIONS
     imstoryboard has a variety of options in the  following  six
     categories:

          File Selection          What input and output files to use
          Format Selection        What image file format to use
          Format Control          What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard                Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Background Generation   Options for storyboard background selection
          Storyboard Options      Parameters for storyboard formatting

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     One input image or the background image, but not  both,  may
     be taken from stdin.

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Input File Names
     Input file names may be given explicitly or implicitly.   In
     an explicit list, the user gives each image file name on the
     command-line for imstoryboard.  The  following  are  typical
     invocations of imstoryboard using explicit file names:

     imstoryboard thing1.rgb thng2.hdf sam.ras i.pix am.rla -out-
     file outputgroup.hdf
     imstoryboard credits0.rgb credits1.rgb credits2.rgb -outfile
     outcredits.tiff
     imstoryboard icons*.ico -outfile myicons.hdf

     File names may be given implicitly by providing a file  name
     template that contains the special character code "%d", like
     the C language printf(3) print format directive.  This  tem-
     plate  will be used to generate a series of image file names
     by replacing the "%d" with integer frame numbers, one  after
     another.   The  template myimage.%d.rgb, for instance, could
     generate  the  file  names   myimage.0.rgb,   myimage.1.rgb,
     myimage.2.rgb, and so on.

     The range of integer frame numbers used  to  generate  input
     file  names from a template is given using the -frames _r_a_n_g_e
     option, where the _r_a_n_g_e is  a  single  value,  or  range  of
     values, taking one of the following forms:

     _r_a_n_g_e   Generate file names with frame numbers of
8     _________________________________________________
     _n       0 through _n (range beginning with zero)
     _n-_m     _n through _m (range of values).

     There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  Also, _n  need
     not be a value less than _m.

     The following are typical invocations of imstoryboard  using
     an implicit file name template and -frames:

     imstoryboard    credits%d.rgb    -frames    0-2     -outfile
     outcredits.tiff
     imstoryboard   -frames   0-200    movie.%03d.ras    -outfile
     collection.hdf
     imstoryboard   -frames   200-0    movie.%03d.ras    -outfile
     reversed.hdf

     Implicit and explicit file naming may  be  combined  on  the
     same command-line, such as:

     imstoryboard   title.rgb   -frames   0-100    movie.%03d.rgb
     credit1.rgb copyright.rgb-outfile output.hdf

     -frames can only be given once.  If more than  one  implicit
     file  name  template  is used on the same command-line, each
     use will use the same frame number range.

     Image files are read in and placed into  the  storyboard  in
     the order in which they appear on the command-line.

  Output File Name
     The output filename may be explicitly specified on the  com-
     mand line, such as:

     imstoryboard title.rgb -frames 0-100 movie.%03d.rgb -outfile
     credit1.rgb -outfile output.hdf

  Background Options
     To use a background image located in an image file the  fol-
     lowing option is specified:

          -backfile _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

     If a background file is not  specified,  a  background  file
     will  be  generated by imstoryboard.  The default background
     is of RGB type with a zero value for all data fields.

     Background fill values are selected using one or more of the
     following fill options:

     Option              Fill each pixel's
8     _________________________________________
     -red _r_a_n_g_e          red component
     -green _r_a_n_g_e        green component
     -blue _r_a_n_g_e         blue component
8     _________________________________________
     -mono _r_a_n_g_e         monochrome component
     -index _r_a_n_g_e        color index component
8     _________________________________________
     -hue _r_a_n_g_e          hue component
     -saturation _r_a_n_g_e   saturation component
     -intensity _r_a_n_g_e    intensity component
8     _________________________________________
     -alpha _r_a_n_g_e        alpha component

     Multiple fill options may be given, as long as color  spaces
     are  not  mixed.   For  instance,  -index  for filling color
     indexes is incompatible with -red for filling the  red  com-
     ponent  of  RGB triplets.  Likewise, -hue for filling pixels
     based upon an HSI color space hue value is incompatible with
     -blue for filling with blue in the RGB color space.  See the
     imintro(3IM) man page for a description of the RGB  and  HSI
     color spaces.

     Each of the fill options can accept  an  argument  giving  a
     single  value, or range of values with which to fill.  Value
     _r_a_n_g_e syntax takes any one of the following forms:

          _r_a_n_g_e   Fill with values of
8          ____________________________________________________________
          _n       _n only.
          _n-      _n through the maximum legal value for the component.
          _n-_m     _n through _m.

There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  _n need  not  be  a
value less than _m.

     When filling with a single value, the entire  background  is
     set to the same value.

     When a range of fill values are given, such as -red 0-255 or
     -intensity  0.6-0.2,  the  background  will be filled with a
     gradation, or ramp, as selected by  the  -graduate  option's
     argument:

     Option                 Meaning
8     ____________________________________________________________
     -graduate none         Fill with a constant value
     -graduate horizontal   Fill with a horizontal ramp (default)
     -graduate vertical     Fill with a vertical ramp

     none, horizontal, and vertical may each  be  abbreviated  to
     the fewest unique letters.

     The horizontal ramp for a graduated  fill  starts  from  the
     first fill value at the left edge of the background and goes
     to the second fill value at the right  edge.   The  vertical
     ramp  for a graduated fill goes from the first fill value at
     the top edge of the fill area to the second  fill  value  at
     the bottom edge.

  Storyboard Options
     -preread may be used to storyboard images  which  come  from
     files  containing  more  than  one image.  With this option,
     each file is read twice:  once  to  discern  the  number  of
     images in the file, and once to read in the actual data.
     The following options are used to control  the  spacing  and
     sizing within a storyboard.  Options are provided to control
     output image size, margin,  gutter,  grid  frame  size,  and
     other  image  placement  operations.   If  an  option is not
     specified a default value will  be  assigned.   The  default
     assignments are described in the NOTES section below.

     Option                Description
8     __________________________________________________________________________
     -xsize _x              Width of output storyboard image, in pixels
     -ysize _y              Height of output storyboard image, in pixels
8     __________________________________________________________________________
     -rows _n_y              Number of grid rows for storyboard
     -columns _n_x           Number of grid columns for storyboard
8     __________________________________________________________________________
     -xframe _x             Width of individual grid frame, in pixels
     -yframe _y             Height of individual grid frame, in pixels
     -scale _s_c_a_l_e_V_a_l_u_e     Fractional amount to scale both grid frame axes
     -xscale _x_S_c_a_l_e_V_a_l_u_e   Fractional amount to scale grid frame width
     -yscale _y_S_c_a_l_e_V_a_l_u_e   Fractional amount to scale grid frame height
8     __________________________________________________________________________
     -xmargin _x            Width for left and right margins, in pixels
     -ymargin _y            Height for top and bottom margins, in pixels
     -xgutter _x            Width to place between storyboard images, in pixels
     -ygutter _y            Height to place between storyboard images, in pixels

     Each of the input images will be scaled to  the  frame  size
     given by -xframe and -yframe.

     The scale options conflict with the -xframe and -yframe, and
     therefore cannot be used together.

NOTES
     If an option is not given on the command-line,  one  of  the
     following defaults will be assigned as the option's value:
Rows and Columns
     If -rows and -columns  are  not  specified,  then  the  most
     square  array  of  rows  and columns, based on the number of
     input files, will be computed.  These formula will determine
     the row and column defaults:

     rows = floor( sqrt( # of input files+0.5 ) )
     columns = ceil( sqrt( # of input files ) )

     Otherwise when -rows or -columns, but not both,  are  speci-
     fied  the  defaults will assign a value large enough to hold
     all of the input images.

     The row and column defaults assume single image input files.
     The  number  of input files is used to calculate the row and
     column defaults for the storyboard.  This action may lead to
     incorrect  row  and  column defaults when an input file con-
     tains more than one image.

     The following outline pertains to both x and y axis options:

     If output size not given
          frame = size of first image
          margin = 10% of frame size
          gutter = 10% of frame size
          output size = enough space to hold above
     Else output size given
          margin = 10% of output size / ( rows or columns )
          gutter = 10% of output size / ( rows or columns )
          frame = what ever is left over at this point

     scale  = 1.0

     Images placed into the storyboard will be scaled to the grid
     frame  size.   The user should select a frame size, or scale
     factor in order to preserve the image's aspect ratio.

     imstoryboard uses  the  C  language  sprintf(3)  routine  to
     replace  the file name template's "%d" with successive image
     frame numbers.  The use of sprintf(3) means the  full  range
     of  "%d"  format directive syntax is available in generating
     input file names.  While the sprintf(3) man  page  has  full
     details on the "%d" print directive, the following is a sum-
     mary as it applies to input file naming:

IMSTORYBOARD(1IM)          IMAGE TOOLS          IMSTORYBOARD(1IM)



     The "%d" directive has the following general syntax:

      "%" [_f_l_a_g_s] [_d_i_g_i_t] ["." _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n] "d"

     The directive always starts with a "%"  character  and  ends
     with  a "d" character.  Field names between [ ]s in the syn-
     tax above are optional.  With no optional field  value,  the
     simplest form of the directive is just "%d".

     _f_l_a_g_s
          Following the "%" is an optional set of  _f_l_a_g_s  charac-
          ters:

     _f_l_a_g      Meaning
8     ___________________________________________________________________________
     -         Left justify the frame number.  Default is right justified.
     +         Include the sign (+ or -) of the frame number. Default is just -.
     (blank)   Use a blank instead of a + for positive frame numbers.

     Except for peculiar file naming, users of  imstoryboard  can
     omit the optional _f_l_a_g_s portion of a print directive.

     _d_i_g_i_t
          Following the _f_l_a_g_s field is an  optional  _d_i_g_i_t  field
          that  gives  the  field width of the number, in charac-
          ters.  If the number requires fewer than this  minimum,
          it  will  be  padded  on  the right or left with blanks
          (padding is controlled by the - _f_l_a_g  above).   If  the
          number  requires  more  than  this  minimum, it will be
          taken.

     The _d_i_g_i_t field can be preceded by a 0 (zero) to cause  pad-
     ding to be done with leading zeroes instead of blanks.  This
     is useful when referring to frame numbers of the form "001,"
     "002," "003," and so on.

     _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n
          The _d_i_g_i_t field may be optionally  followed  by  a  "."
          (period)  and a _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n number that gives the minimum
          number of digits for the frame number.  This isn't par-
          ticularly  useful  for users of imstoryboard and can be
          skipped.

     The following are a few typical "%d" directives for  use  in
     imstoryboard:

                 the  number.   Generates  numbers like "000,"

7                 Same effect as "%03d"

     Storyboarding takes place without regard  to  alpha  planes,
     write  protect planes, and so on.  The input image is always
     placed pixel-for-pixel atop the background image in the sto-
     ryboard.

     Internally, an input image is converted to the same depth as
     the  background  image  prior  to being pasted on the story-
     board.

     Pasting of non-RGB images can cause unexpected  results  but
     is  allowed.   Consider this scenario:  An input color index
     image uses color indexes 1, 2, and 3  for  red,  green,  and
     blue.   The  background color index image uses color indexes
     1, 2, and 3 as  well,  but  its  color  lookup  table  (CLT)
     defines  them  as  orange, white, and black.  When the input
     image is pasted atop the background image, its color indexes
     are copied across and use the background image's CLT.  Input
     pixels that used to be red become orange, input green pixels
     become  white,  and  input  blue pixels become black because
     they now reference the background image's CLT.  If  this  is
     not what you want, convert the images to RGB prior to invok-
     ing imstoryboard.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.
