NAME
     imsplit  -  Splits a multi-image file into separate files

SYNOPSIS
     imsplit [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imsplit reads in the multi-image input file and  splits  its
     contents into multiple single-image output files.  The input
     and output image file formats may be different.

OPTIONS
     imsplit has a variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Output File Names
     Output file names are generated automatically based  upon  a
     given  output  file  name  template.  The file name template
     must include the special character code  "%d",  like  the  C
     language  printf(3)  print  format directive.  This template
     will be used to generate a series of output image file names
     by  replacing the "%d" with integer frame numbers, one after
     another.  The template myimage.%d.rgb, for  instance,  could
     generate   the   file  names  myimage.0.rgb,  myimage.1.rgb,
     myimage.2.rgb, and so on.

     By default, all images in the input file are split  out  and
     written  to  separate  image files.  File name frame numbers
     will range from 0 (for the first image) to _n-_1 (for the last
     image), where _n is the number of images in the input file.

     The -frames _l_i_s_t... option may be given one or more times to
     explicitly  list  the  input  file  frames  that  are  to be
     extracted.  The -frames option takes a list of one  or  more
     _r_a_n_g_e_s,  each  of  which  is  a  single value, or a range of
     values taking one of the following forms:

          _r_a_n_g_e   Extract Frames
8          ____________________________________________
          _n       _n only.
          _n-      _n through the end of the input file.

          _n-_m     _n through _m.

     There is no space between _n, the dash, and _m.  _n need not be
     a value less than _m.

     Frame numbers listed in -frames options will be the same  as
     those used for generating output file names.

     The following  are  typical  invocations  of  imsplit  using
     -frames lists:

          imsplit many.hdf -frames 0 1 2 image.%d.tiff
          imsplit many.hdf -frames 0-5 6 7 9-12 image.%d.rgb
          imsplit many.hdf -frames 9-12 6 0-3 image.%02d.ras
          imsplit many.hdf -frame 0 -frame 1 -frame 32 -frame 8-10 5 image.%d.gif

NOTES
     All of the output files will be written using the same image
     file  format.   This need not be the same as the file format
     used by the input file.

     Multi-image files handled by imsplit may  be  created  using
     imcat(1IM).

     Most image file formats cannot support the storage of multi-
     ple  images  in  the same file.  This is a limitation of the
     file format design, not imsplit.

     imsplit uses the C language sprintf(3)  routine  to  replace
     the file name template's "%d" with image frame numbers.  The
     use of sprintf(3) means the full range of "%d" format direc-
     tive  syntax  is  available in generating output file names.
     While the sprintf(3) man page has full details on  the  "%d"
     print directive, the following is a summary as it applies to
     output file naming:

          The "%d" directive has the following general syntax:

                "%" [_f_l_a_g_s] [_d_i_g_i_t] ["." _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n] "d"

          The directive always starts with a  "%"  character  and
          ends  with  a "d" character.  Field names between the [
          ]s in the syntax above are optional.  With no  optional
          field value, the simplest form of the directive is just
          "%d".

          _f_l_a_g_s
               Following the "%" is  an  optional  set  of  _f_l_a_g_s
               characters:

                    _f_l_a_g      Meaning
8                    ________________________________________________________________
                    -         Left-justify the frame number.

                    +         Always use the sign (+ or -) of the number.
                    (blank)   Use a blank instead of a + for positive frame numbers.

               Except for peculiar file naming, users of  imsplit
               can  omit  the  optional  _f_l_a_g_s portion of a print
               directive.

          _d_i_g_i_t
               Following the _f_l_a_g_s is  an  optional  _d_i_g_i_t  field
               that gives the field width of the number, in char-
               acters.  If the number requires  fewer  than  this
               minimum,  it  will  be padded on the right or left
               with blanks (padding is controlled by the  -  _f_l_a_g
               mentioned above). If the number requires more than
               this minimum, it will be taken.

               The _d_i_g_i_t field can be preceded by a 0  (zero)  to
               cause  padding  to  be  done  with  leading  zeros
               instead of blanks.  This is useful when  referring
               to  frame numbers of the form "001," "002," "003,"
               and so on.

          _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n
               The _d_i_g_i_t field may be optionally  followed  by  a
               "." (period) and a _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n number that gives the
               minimum number of digits  for  the  frame  number.
               This   isn't  particularly  useful  for  users  of
               imsplit and can be skipped.

          The following are a few typical "%d" directives for use
          in imsplit:

               %d   No  leading  zeros  or   blanks.    Generates
                    numbers like "0," "1," "2," "3," etc.

               %03d Leading zeros to fill 3 characters, including
                    the  number.   Generates  numbers like "000,"
                    "001," "002," "003," etc.

               %.3d Same effect as "%03d".

     In order to split  apart  multi-image  files,  imsplit  must
     first  read  in the entire file's image data.  This can take
     up quite a bit of memory, as well as take a long  time.   If
     the host does not have enough memory and swap space, imsplit
     will fail with a memory allocation error.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page for imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.
