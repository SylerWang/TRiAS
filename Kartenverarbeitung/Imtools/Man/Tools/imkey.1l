DESCRIPTION
     imkey imkey places a  foreground  image  over  a  background
     image,  letting  the  background  show  through wherever the
     foreground's pixels match a key  color  specifified  on  the
     command-line.   The  resulting  image is stored to an output
     file.  Input and output files may have different image  file
     formats.

OPTIONS
     imkey has a variety of options in the following categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Field(s)           Key color (or other field) selection
          Positioning        Position foreground onto background
          Subregion          Select a subregion of the foreground

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Keying
     _K_e_y_i_n_g is a technique that  combines  pixels  of  two  input
     images  together  to create a third _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e image.  _K_e_y_i_n_g
     is commonly used to take two separately computed images  and
     combine  them,  with  portions  of the foreground made tran-
     sparent so that the background can show  through.   In  such
     cases the first input image would act as a _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d image,
     and the second as a _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d image.

     Foreground and background images can be composited  together
     to  create  a  variety  of  special effects, or as an aid to
     speed up the rendering of complex scenery.  For instance,  a
     complex computer-generated robot must walk across the screen
     in front of a computer-generated library filled with  books.
     The  library  could  be modeled, book by book, and the robot
     modeled, joint for joint.  An image showing the robot in the
     library could be rendered by combining both models and send-
     ing the entire mass of geometry off to the renderer  all  at
     once.  A single image would result.

     To render an animation of the robot moving in front  of  the
     library  one  could  send  both  masses  of  geometry to the
     renderer for each frame.  However, the library is static  in
     this  scene  and  the  interaction between the robot and its
     books nil.  The time spent rendering, and rerendering,  each
     library  book, frame after frame is a waste and dramatically
     increases the rendering time of the animation.

     A more efficient approach would  be  to  render  the  static
     library  just once, without the robot.  The robot would then
     be rendered for each frame, but without the  library  behind
     it  (just a solid black background).  Once rendering is com-
     plete,  the  separate  foreground  (robot)  and   background
     (library) images can be keyed together to create a series of
     frames showing the robot moving in  front  of  the  library.
     The  total  rendering time for such an approach is consider-
     ably less.

     Such compositing tricks are regularly used in  Hollywood  in
     order  to place actors in front of locations they aren't in,
     or to make spaceships fly all about  in  front  of  swirling
     planets  or  sparkley star fields.  In video this same tech-
     nique is used to  place  the  weather  man  in  front  of  a
     computer-generated weather map.

     In each of these cases, the keying operation must know  what
     portions  of  the  foreground  image to paste over the back-
     ground image.

     The net effect is that the foreground image is  pasted  over
     the  background  image  letting  the background show through
     where the foreground's pixels are satisfied  by  the  keying
     information.

  Field(s)
     Users may choose key off of specific foreground fields using
     one of the following options.

          Option        Key foreground off of...
8          _____________________________________________
          -mono         the monochrome field
          -index        the color index field
8          _____________________________________________
          -red          the red field
          -green        the green field

          -saturation   on the virtual saturation field
          -intensity    on the virtual intensity field

     In general, a key field named by any of  the  above  options
     must exist in both input images.  For instance, keying using
     -index for color index fields  doesn't  make  sense  on  RGB

     images.  A certain amount of automatic image type conversion
     is performed by imkey in order to make things a  little  bit
     more flexible:

     -mono
          Monochrome keying requires that both input images  have
          monochrome image fields.

     -index
          Color index keying requires that both input images have
          color index image fields.

     -red, -green, -blue
          Keying on red, green, or  blue  fields  works  for  any
          image, whether monochrome, grayscale, color indexed, or
          RGB.  Such images are promoted internally to RGB images
          in order to accomplish the keying.

     -hue, -saturation, -intensity
          Keying on the virtual image fields of hue,  saturation,
          or  intensity  works  for  any image type.  Input image
          color field values are converted internally to the  HSI
          color space in order to accomplish the compositing.

  Positioning
     There also exist provisions for positioning and  sizing  the
     foreground  image.   This  is  useful since sometimes only a
     part of the foreground is  desired  in  the  composite.  The
     positioning  of  the foreground in respect to the background
     is useful if the foreground needs to be somewhere other than
     the  upper  left  hand  corner  of  the  image, which is the
     default.

          -xposition x   Specify left edge of foreground into background
          -yposition y   Specify top edge of foreground into background

     -xposition -yposition
          Allows you to position  the  foreground  in  the  back-
          ground. The foreground can be positioned at a new X and
          Y position other than the default, which is  0  and  0.
          Negative  values for for X and Y are allowed. This will
          simply move the foreground off the left edge and/or the
          top  edge  of  the background. Those areas of the fore-
          ground that are wide enough  and/or  long  enough  will
          extend  back  into  the  final  image.   Quantities are
          specified in pixels.

  Subregion
     A subregion of the foreground image may  be  selected  using
     -xstart,  -ystart,  -xsize, and -ysize.  Start values are in
     pixels measured from (0,0) in the upper left-hand corner  of
     the  foreground  image.   Size  values are in pixels.  Start

     values must be positive and size values  must  result  in  a
     subregion wholely contained within the foreground image.

          -xstart x       Specify left edge in foreground data
          -ystart y       Specify top edge in foreground data
          -xsize width    Specify width of foreground data
          -ysize height   Specify height of foreground data

     -xstart -ystart
          -xstart and -ystart each default to (0,0) in the  fore-
          ground  image.   -xsize  and -ysize each default to the
          full image width and height from the starting  location
          to the edge of the foreground image.

     -xsize -ysize
          A subregion of the foreground  image  may  be  selected
          using  -xstart,  -ystart,  -xsize,  and  -ysize.  Start
          values are in pixels measured from (0,0) in  the  upper
          left-hand  corner of the foreground image.  Size values
          are in pixels.  Start values must be positive and  size
          values  must  result  in  a subregion wholely contained
          within the foreground image.

NOTES
     See the NOTES section of imcomp for a description of typical
     uses  of  compositing  and  notes  reguarding  the composite
     operation itself. Since  imkey  uses  the  same  compositing
     function as imcomp, the text written for it will be helpful.

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     Key one Sun Rasterfile image onto another,  only  key  where
     the pixels are red from 20 to 128:

          imkey inone.ras intwo.ras -red 20-128 out.ras

     Key using green in the range of 30  to  200,  and  move  the
     foreground image right by 20 pixels and down by 50:

          imkey inone.ras intwo.ras  -red  30-200  -xposition  20
          -yposition 50 out.ras

     Key only using a rectangular sub-region of  the  foreground.
     The left-hand edge of the foreground will start at 10 pixels
     in from the left edge of foreground and will  be  30  pixels
     wide  and 40 pixels high against the background. Key on blue
     in the range of 0 to 128:
