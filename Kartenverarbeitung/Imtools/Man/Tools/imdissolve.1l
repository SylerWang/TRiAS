NAME
     imdissolve  -  Dissolve any field  between  two  images  and
     store in a new file

SYNOPSIS
     imdissolve [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imdissolve reads each image in the input files and dissolves
     their  fields  together,  then writes it to the output file.
     The input and output image file formats may be different.

OPTIONS
     imdissolve has a variety of options in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     -infile1 <file> specifies the first image to dissolve.

     -infile2 <file> specifies the second image to dissolve.

     -outfile <file> specifies the output image filename.

     -weight <value> or <start-end> specifies weights to  use  in
     dissolving.

     -frames <value> or <start-end> specifies how many frames  in
     dissolve sequence.

     -frameincrement <value> specifies how to  increment  through
     the frames.

     blue fields.

     -redfield specifies to dissolve just the red field.

     -greenfield specifies to dissolve just the green field.

     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     Typical Fade-to-black Invocations:
         Dim a single image to 50%:

                  imdissolve  -weight  0.5   image.pix   -outfile
          result.hdf

         Generate 20 frames fading a static image to black:

                  imdissolve image.pix -frames 20 result.%02d.ras

         Generate 20 frames fading from black to a static image:

                  imdissolve -weight 0.0-1.0 -frames 20 image.rla
          result.%02d.xwd

         Fade to black a sequence of 10 frames (10-19):

                  imdissolve    -frames    10-19     anim%05d.gif
          final.%05d.tiff

     Typical Dissolve Between Frames Invocations:
         Mix together 50% each of two images:

                  imdissolve  -weight  0.5  first.pix  second.rla
          output.pcx

         Mix together 70% of the first  image  with  30%  of  the
     second:

                  imdissolve  -weight  0.7  first.pix  second.rla
          output.pcx

         Generate 30 frames dissolving between two static images:

                  imdissolve static1.gif static2.gif  -frames  30
          anim.%03d.gif

         Dissolve a sequence of 10 frames into a static image:

                  imdissolve    anim.%02d.tiff    -frames     0-9
          static.ras resultanim.%03d.x

         Dissolve between two sequences of 100 frames:

                  imdissolve first.%d.hdf  second.%d.hdf  -frames
          100 final.%d.hdf

         Dissolve between two sequences of 100 frames  outputting
     every 10th frame:

                  imdissolve first.%d.hdf  second.%d.hdf  -frames
          100 -frameincrement 10 final.%d.hdf

     The default actions are as followed:
          The default is to expect two input files and an  output
     file if only one
               input file is given then the output file  must  be
     preceeded by -outfile
               and the second image will be defaulted to a  black
     image.
          The default is to dissolve all of the fields.
          The default start weight is 1.0 and the end  weight  is
     0.0.
          The default start and end frames are 0.

     Here is what happens when  dissolve  is  invocated  and  the
     input files only hold a single image:

8          __________________________________________________

     the same number of files.
     To output multiple files the output file name must have a  %
     in it.

     Here is what happens when  dissolve  is  invocated  and  the
     input files can have more than a single image:

8          _____________________________________________________

           single image      single image      single image
           multiple images   single image      multiple images
           single image      multiple images   multiple images
           multiple images   multiple images   multiple images
8          _____________________________________________________
7         |8|7|7|7|7|



9                                                              |8|7|7|7|7|




9     If both input names have multiple images then they must have
     the same number of images.

     No matter what, if there is a mixture of mutiple files  that
     have multiple images then imdissolve will get angry.

     If the input images do not use rgb color type then they will
     be  changed  to  rgb and then dissolved and outputted as rgb
     unless a different output invocation is explicitly  enterred
     overriding the rgb.
