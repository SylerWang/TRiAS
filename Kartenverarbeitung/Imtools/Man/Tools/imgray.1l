NAME
     imgray  -  Convert an image to grayscale

SYNOPSIS
     imgray [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imgray converts an input image to grayscale, then writes  it
     to  an output image file.  If the input file contains multi-
     ple images, imgray converts each one and writes  it  to  the
     output file.  The input and output image file formats may be
     different.

OPTIONS
     imgray has a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  four
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

NOTES
     Conversion from color to grayscale computes the  gray  value
     for each pixel using the NTSC Y equation:

               Gray ~~=~~ 0.30*R ~+~ 0.59*G ~+~ 0.11*B

     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To convert an RGB Alias pix  file  image  to  grayscale  and
     store  it in an hdf file, enter any of the following command
     lines:

          imgray picture.pix picture.hdf
              or
          imgray -informat pix picture.pix -outformat hdf picture.hdf
              or
          imgray -informat pix - picture.hdf < picture.pix
              or
          imgray -informat pix picture.pix -outformat hdf - > picture.hdf

     See the individual file format man pages for the authors  of
     the  underlying  format  read  and write code.  The names of
     these man pages begin with the letters "im" followed by  the
     format  name.  For example, the name of the TIFF man page is
     imtiff.  To display it, enter man imtiff.
