NAME
     imfile  -  Discerns the image format of a file or files

SYNOPSIS
     imfile [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_1 _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_2 ...

DESCRIPTION
     imfile attempts to discern the image  format  of  each  file
     listed on the command line, much like the UNIX file(1) util-
     ity.  imfile outputs the name of the file and its image file
     format to stdout.

OPTIONS
     Invoke imfile with one or more  filenames,  optionally  pre-
     ceded by the -infile argument:

          imfile -infile picture.pix newpic.ras
              or
          imfile picture.pix newpic.ras

     imfile checks each file for a magic  number  and  file  name
     extension,  then  prints to stdout its conclusions about the
     file's format.  When the -long option is given, imfile reads
     in  each image file and prints to stdout additional informa-
     tion about the file.  -long information includes the  file's
     format  and  format  version  (if applicable), the number of
     images contained in the file, image resolution,  image  type
     (color  indexed,  RGB, etc), the size of its color table (if
     any), the type of image compression used by  the  file,  and
     other data relevant to the particular image file format.

     If the file being queried is compressed (e.g. with .Z,  .gz,
     or   .z  compression),  then  imfile  will  not  attempt  to
     uncompress it.   Instead it will realize that  the  file  is
     compressed,  (by  using  the file's magic number or filename
     suffix),  and  then  announce  that  you  are   querying   a
     compressed  file.  If you wish to uncompress a file and dis-
     cern its format, then the  -long option must be used.

     imfile also recognizes the following standard SDSC options:

     -feedback
          Creates a software feedback (bug report)  form  in  the
          file imfile.fbk.0.

     -fullhelp
          Displays a detailed list of the arguments  and  how  to
          use imfile.

     -help
          Displays an abbreviated list of the arguments  and  how
          to use imfile.

     -register
          Creates a software-user registration form in  the  file
          imfile.reg.0.

     -version
          Displays the version number and copyright for imfile.

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

NOTES
     imfile discerns the type of a file  first  by  checking  the
     file's  magic  number  against a magic number list for known
     image formats and file compression formats.   If  the  magic
     number  doesn't match any of those in the list, imfile looks
     at the filename's suffix (the characters following the  last
     period  in  the  filename)  and  checks it against a list of
     known image filename suffixes and file compression suffixes.

     If imfile cannot determine the format of a file, it  outputs
     the string "Unknown image file format."

EXAMPLES
     Determine the types of three files:

          imfile thing1.pix thing2.hdf dr.who

     The above command outputs:

          thing1.pix:   'pix', Alias image file, Alias Research, Inc.
          thing2.hdf:   'hdf', Hierarchical Data File, NCSA
          dr.who:       Unknown image file format


     Display specific information about  two  image  files  using
     -long:

          imfile walking.pict dolphin.pix

     The above command outputs:

          walking.pict:   'pict', Apple Macintosh QuickDraw/PICT file, Apple Computer, Inc.
                          Version:                              2 (32-bit QuickDraw PICT2)
                          Byte Order:                           Most Significant Byte First
                          Resolution:                           646 x 470
                          Type:                                 8-bit Color Indexed
                          Color Table:                          237 Entries
                          Compression Type:                     Apple Macintosh PackBits
          dolphin.pix:    'pix', Alias image file, Alias Research, Inc.
                          Byte Order:                           Most Significant Byte First
                          Resolution:                           420 x 420
                          Type:                                 24-bit RGB

     See the individual file format man pages for the authors  of
     the  underlying  format  read  and write code.  The names of
     these man pages begin with the letters "im" followed by  the
     format  name.  For example, the name of the TIFF man page is
     imtiff.  To display it, enter man imtiff.
