NAME
     imhist  -  compute a histogram of an image

SYNOPSIS
     imhist [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [_o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]

DESCRIPTION
     imhist reads each image in the input  file  and  computes  a
     histogram  by  counting  the  number  of occurrences of each
     unique color in the image.  A table of  the  computed  data,
     sorted  from  high  to  low,  plus a header of general image
     statistics is written to the output file, or  stdout  if  no
     output file is given.

OPTIONS
     imhist has a variety of options in the following categories:

          File Selection     What input file to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Output Control     What to output
          Fields             What fields to use in computing the histogram

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, and _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  options  are
     common to all SDSC image tools and are discussed in depth in
     the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Output Options
     imhist computes a variety of image statistics, as well as  a
     histogram of image colors.  When complete, a report is writ-
     ten to the output file or stdout that contains a header fol-
     lowed by the histogram occurrence table.

     The output report's header contains the  following  informa-
     tion:

          File:                     image file name
          Resolution:               image resolution
          Number of Pixels:         number of pixels in image
          Number of Combinations:   number of unique color combinations
          Maximum:                  maximum field value for each histogram field
          Minimum:                  minimum field value for each histogram field
          Unique Values:            number of unique field values for each histogram field
          Column headings           headings for columns in the histogram occurrence table

     Printing of the header information may be suppressed by giv-
     ing the -outnoheader option.  By default the header informa-
     tion is output.

     The histogram occurrence table gives a list  of  the  unique
     color  combinations  that occurred in the image, and a count
     of the number of times they occurred.  The table  is  sorted
     to  place  the most-often occurring colors at the top of the
     table.  Table values are printed one color to a line  start-
     ing with the occurrence value, followed by the value of each
     histogram pixel field.  For example, the following  are  the
     first  few  lines of a histogram table generated on a simple
     RGB image:

           ...      ...    ...     ...
          Number   RED    GREEN   BLUE
          1004     255    0       0
          842      128    255     0
          712      0      0       255
          500      0      0       0
           ...      ...    ...     ...

     In this example, the histogram data shows  that  there  were
     1004   occurrences   of  pixels  with  the  RGB  combination
     (255,0,0), and 842 occurrences of pixels with an  RGB  value
     of (128,255,0).  And so on.

     Calculation and printing  of  the  histogram  table  may  be
     suppressed by giving the -outnohistogram option.  By default
     the histogram information is output.

     Sorting of the histogram  occurrence  data  on  pathological
     cases  can  take as long as collecting the data in the first
     place.  If sorting is not important to your use of the data,
     you  may  suppress  sorting by giving the -outnosort option.
     By default the histogram  occurrence  data  is  sorted  from
     most-often occurring to least-often occurring.

  Fields
     By default, imhist computes a histogram on all fields  (red,
     green,  blue,  alpha,  color index, etc) in the input image.
     Alternatively, the user may direct  imhist  to  specifically
     compute  a  histogram  on  selected image fields, or virtual
     fields (such as hue, saturation, and intensity) by selecting
     the fields of interest on the command-line.

     Legal field selections depend upon the  image  type.   Color
     indexed  images  (images  that use a color lookup table) may
     have histograms computed on their color indexes, RGB  values
     (as  looked up in their color lookup tables), and HSI values
     (derived from RGB values  looked  up  in  the  color  lookup
     table).

     RGB images may have histograms computed on RGB values or  on
     HSI values (derived from the RGB values).

     Images with alpha channels may have histograms  computed  on
     alpha values.

     Histograms   may   not   be   computed   that   mix    color
     spaces/representations.   For  instance,  histograms on -red
     -index or -green -hue don't make sense.

NOTES
     imhist computes correlated field histograms.  Each color  in
     the output histogram is a unique combination of the selected
     input fields.  For instance, say an image has the  following
     RGB colors:

          RED   GREEN   BLUE
8          __________________
          0     0       0
          255   0       0
          0     255     255
          128   128     255
          255   255     255

     A histogram on the red field alone would report  that  there
     are 3 different unique values:  0, 128, and 255.  Similarly,
     independent single-field histograms on the  green  and  blue
     fields would report that green has 0, 128, and 255 as unique
     values, and blue has just 0 and 255 as unique values.

     A correlated histogram on all three fields,  however,  would
     report each unique combination of red, green, and blue field
     values that occur in the image.  The  answer  would  be  the
     table  listed  above.   In  the  table  the second and fifth
     colors both have red values of  255,  but  differ  in  their
     green  and  blue  components.   This  makes  them  different
     colors, and thus different entries in the histogram.

     Non-correlated single-field histograms are handy if you just
     want to see how many pixels have some amount of red in them.
     However, what if you want to know how many  have  yellow  in
     them?   For  that  you need to correlate a histogram showing
     red and green values.  Independent red and green  histograms
     wouldn't show you anything useful.

     imhist may be used to compute either single-field histograms
     or   multiple-field   correlated   histograms.   To  compute
     single-field histograms on red and green, for instance,  run
     imhist  twice,  once with the -red option, and once with the
     -green option.  Alternatively, to compute a red-green corre-
     lated  histogram,  run  imhist  with  both  the -red and the
     -green options at the same time.

     Computing single-field histograms is very quick and  doesn't
     use much memory.  Computing multiple-field correlated histo-
     grams can take quite a bit longer and use a lot more memory,
     depending  upon the number of correlated fields, the size of
     the image, and the number of unique  color  combinations  in
     the  image.   The  following  table  provides an idea of the
     memory explosion that can result when  computing  correlated
     histograms.   The table's values are based upon a worst case
     1024 x 1280 image with every pixel a different color.

     The memory use  reported  above  is  for  intermediate  data
     structures  internal  to  imhist.   This  does  not  include
     storage in memory of the image itself, nor any of the  other
     administrative data structures needed.

     Of note on this table is the use of some 22Mb  for  internal
     data  when  computing an HSI-Alpha correlated histogram on a
     pathological case 1280 x 1024 image.  If your  host  doesn't
     have  22Mb  (plus  overhead) of memory, or the equivalent in
     swap space, imhist will be unabled to compute the histogram.
     Every effort has been made in imhist to keep memory use to a
     minimum.  This high use of memory for correlated  histograms
     cannot  be  avoided without resorting to temporary files for
     data  storage,  and  the  attendant  sever  execution  speed
     impact.

     Please note again that this table was produced for a  patho-
     logical  image  that  had a different color for every pixel.
     Most images have considerably fewer colors.  In typical use,
     memory will not be a problem.

     Computation time for correlated histograms also goes up with
     the  number of correlated fields, the size of the image, and
     the number of unique colors.  The following table shows com-

     Column two gives the fields used in computing the histogram.
     Column three  shows  the  number  of  unique  colors  found.
     Columns four, five, and six show execution times for reading
     in the image, computing the histogram, and writing  out  the
     data  respectively.   The  final column sums these execution
     times.

     This  table  illustrates  that  larger  images  with  larger
     numbers  of  unique  colors drastically increase the time it
     takes to compute a correlated  histogram.   This  is  to  be
     expected.   The  table  also shows that computing in the HSI
     domain, instead of RGB, takes longer.  This is  due  to  the
     use  of  floating  point computations and RGB-to-HSI conver-
     sions everywhere.

     Error messages are reported to stderr.
