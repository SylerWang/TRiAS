NAME
     imflip  -  Flip images vertically or horizontally and  store
     in a new file

SYNOPSIS
     imflip [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imflip reads each image in the input file and flips it vert-
     ically,  horizontally, or both, then writes it to the output
     file.  The input and output image file formats may  be  dif-
     ferent.

OPTIONS
     imflip has a  variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     -xflip flips the image left-to-right.

     -yflip flips the image top-to-bottom.

     -xflip and -yflip together flip the image left-to-right  and
     top-to-bottom.

NOTES
     For notes regarding  file  format  conversion  and  standard
     image tool options, see the man page on imconv(1IM).

     Error messages are reported to stderr.

EXAMPLES
     To flip a Wavefront RLB file  top-to-bottom  and  store  the
     result into an SGI RGB file, use the following:

          imflip rightsideup.rlb -yflip upsidedown.rgb

     To flip a TIFF image left-to-right  and  top-to-bottom,  use
     the following:

IMFLIP(1IM)                IMAGE TOOLS                IMFLIP(1IM)



          imflip unflipped.tiff -xflip -yflip flipped.tiff

     To copy an entire input GIF image to a PCX file without  any
     flipping, use the following:

          imflip incoming.gif outgoing.pcx

     With no flip arguments, the actions of imflip default to the
     same  as  the SDSC image format conversion tool imconv(1IM),
     but they take a little longer.
