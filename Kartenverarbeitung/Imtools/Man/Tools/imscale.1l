NAME
     imscale  -  Scales an image up or down and saves it in a new
     file

SYNOPSIS
     imscale [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     imscale scales an input image up or down to a new  size  and
     saves  the result in a new file.  If the input file contains
     multiple images, each input image is scaled in the same  way
     and  is  written  to  the output file.  The input and output
     image file formats may be different.

OPTIONS
     imscale has a variety  of  options  in  the  following  five
     categories:

          File Selection     What input and output files to use
          Format Selection   What image file format to use
          Format Control     What variant of a file format to generate
          Standard           Standard generic options on all SDSC tools
          Manipulation       How the image can be manipulated

     _F_i_l_e _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _S_e_l_e_c_t_i_o_n, _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_n_t_r_o_l, and  _S_t_a_n_-
     _d_a_r_d options are common to all SDSC image tools and are dis-
     cussed in depth in the man page for imconv(1IM).

     All options can be abbreviated to the first few unique char-
     acters.

  Manipulation Options
     Images may be scaled in the X (horizontal) and Y  (vertical)
     directions  by  specifying  a  scale factor or the new image
     size:

          -scale _x_y_f   Scale horizontally and vertically by factor
          -xscale _x_f   Scale horizontally by factor
          -yscale _y_f   Scale vertically by factor
          -xsize _w     Scale the image to a new size horizontally
          -ysize _h     Scale the image to a new size vertically

     -scale, -xscale and -yscale each take a  positive  floating-
     point scale factor.  To increase the size of an image, use a
     scale factor greater than 1.0.  To decrease an image's size,
     use  a scale factor less than 1.0.  The default scale factor
     is 1.0 (no change).

     -xsize and -ysize each take a positive integer  image  width
     or  height  in  pixels, respectively.  The incoming image is
     scaled up or down, as necessary,  to  make  it  the  desired
     size.  The default is to leave the image size unchanged.

     These four arguments may be given alone, or  in  combination
     with the others as long as -xscale is not given with -xsize,
     and -yscale is not given with -ysize.  -scale cannot be used
     in  combination  with  any of the other scale and size argu-
     ments.

     The algorithm used to resize the image may be controlled by:

          -bilinear   Use bilinear interpolation
          -pixelrep   Use pixel replication

     If no algorithm is selected, imscale  defaults  to  bilinear
     interpolation.

NOTES
  Increasing Image Size
     Increasing the size of an image increases the number of pix-
     els  in  the  image.   The colors used by the new additional
     pixels are determined by  the  resolution  change  algorithm
     chosen.

     -pixelrep performs the pixel replication, a simple  form  of
     resolution  change.   Using  pixel  replication, doubling an
     image's size fills in new pixels by copying, or replicating,
     adjacent  pixels.  For instance, an input image has the fol-
     lowing scanline:

          A C E G I K M

     Each letter is a different color in the  image.   When  this
     image is doubled in size using pixel replication, each pixel
     on the scanline becomes  two  pixels,  both  with  the  same
     color.  The resized scanline will be:

          A A C C E E G G I I K K M M

     This has an effect similar to looking at the  image  with  a
     magnifying  glass.   Small  pixels  become big pixels; small
     jaggies become big jaggies.

     -pixelrep may only be used when  the  new  image  width  and
     height  are  each  multiples  of  the  input image width and
     height.  If they are not, imscale will exit with an error.

     -bilinear performs bilinear interpolation  to  increase  the
     image  size.  This method resamples the input image by over-
     laying atop the input image a mathematical grid with _w_i_d_t_h _x
     _h_e_i_g_h_t  points.  This gives one grid point for each pixel in
     the output image.  The input image is then sampled  at  each
     grid  point  to  determine  the output image's pixel colors.
     Where grid points lie directly over the center of  a  source
     pixel,  the  grid point's color is that of the source pixel.

     Where grid points lie between input pixel centers, the  grid
     point's   color  is  determined  by  linearly  interpolating
     between adjacent pixel colors (vertically and horizontally).
     For instance, an input image has the following scanline:

          A C E G I K M

     Each letter is a different color in the  image.   To  double
     this  image's  size,  a  mathematical grid will be overlaid.
     Gridpoints will fall on the center  of  pixel  'A,'  halfway
     between  pixel  'A' and 'C,' on the center of pixel 'C,' and
     so on.  Output image pixels for gridpoints centered on  'A,'
     'C,'  'E,'  etc.,  will  have  those pixel's colors.  Output
     image pixels for gridpoints in-between 'A,' 'C,' 'E,'  etc.,
     will  have  colors interpolated between 'A' and 'C,' 'C' and
     'E,' and so on.  The resized scanline will be:

          A B C D E F G H I J K L M N

     When using bilinear interpolation, the larger resized  image
     will  appear  blurry.   Hard edges become softer and jaggies
     less obvious.  Bilinear interpolation is the default if nei-
     ther -bilinear or -pixelrep options are given.

     -bilinear may be used for scaling an image up by  any  arbi-
     trary scaling factor.  It is not limited to multiples of the
     source image size, as is -pixelrep.

  Decreasing Image Size
     Decreasing the size of an image decreases the number of pix-
     els  in  the  image.   The choice of how to color the pixels
     that remain depends upon the resizing algorithm chosen.

     -pixelrep is only applicable to increasing image size.   The
     algorithm  may  not  be  used  when  the image size is being
     decreased.  imscale will exit with an error if -pixelrep  is
     used when decreasing an image's size.

     -bilinear may be used to decrease an image's size using bil-
     inear  interpolation.  Pixel values in the resulting smaller
     image will be  determined  by  interpolating  between  pixel
     values  in  the  input  image in much the same way used when
     increasing an image's size.

     Bilinear interpolation is the default if  neither  -bilinear
     or -pixelrep options are given.

  Misc
     Image scaling can take awhile, depending upon  the  size  of
     the  input  image,  the  size  of  the output image, and the
     resizing algorithm used.

EXAMPLES
     To scale a 640x480 image up to 1280x1024 (non-uniform  scal-
     ing) using bilinear interpolation, use any of the following:

          imscale small.pix -xscale 2.0 -yscale 2.133 large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -xsize 1280 -ysize 1024 large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -xsize 1280 -ysize 1024 -bilinear large.pix

     To scale a 640x480 image up to  1280x960  (uniform  scaling)
     using pixel replication, use:

          imscale small.pix -scale 2.0 -pixelrep large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -xscale 2.0 -yscale 2.0 -pixelrep large.pix

     To scale the same  image  up  using  bilinear  interpolation
     instead, use any of the following:

          imscale small.pix -scale 2.0 -bilinear large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -scale 2.0 large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -xscale 2.0 -yscale 2.0 -bilinear large.pix
              or
          imscale small.pix -xscale 2.0 -yscale 2.0 large.pix

     To reduce an image to 1/3 its original size in X, and  scale
     it up or down to 500 pixels high in Y, using bilinear inter-
     polation, use the following:

          imscale   original.rla   -xscale   0.333   -ysize   500
          sized.tiff

     To copy an entire input GIF image to  a  PCX  file,  without
     scaling, use the following:

          imscale incoming.gif outgoing.pcx

     With no scaling arguments, the actions of imscale default to
     the   same   as   the  SDSC  image  format  conversion  tool
     imconv(1IM), but they take a little longer.
