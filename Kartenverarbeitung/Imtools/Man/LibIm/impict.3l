DESCRIPTION
     The PICT file is the standard  Apple  Macintosh  image  file
     format.   It  can  be  read by almost any Macintosh graphics
     application. Most Macintosh  applications  that  can  export
     graphics do so in the PICT file format.

FILE RECOGNITION
     pict files are recognized by these filename suffixes:  .pict
     and .pict2.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Apple pict format does not
     require  use  of  Apple  tools  or  hardware and contains no
     proprietary code.  Apple pict format handling  is  available
     on  any  machine  for which the SDSC image library is avail-
     able.

  Reading Apple PICT files
     The SDSC image library reads 1-, 2-,  4-,  and  8-bit  color
     index  images  with  a  CLUT (Color LookUp Table) as well as
     16-,  and  32-bit  direct  color  images,  compressed  using
     Apple's PackBits.

     Note that all pict images are read into IMVFBRGB VFBs.  This
     is  necessary  because  of  a  pict feature that allows each
     piece of an image to have its  own  CLT.   This  can  easily
     exceed  any  reasonable  size  color  index  image  CLT very
     quickly.  To avoid this, incoming image  pieces  in  a  pict
     file are always converted and stored into an RGB VFB.

     Both type 1 (monochrome and "old" color) and  type  2  (full
     color) pict files are handled.

  Writing Apple PICT files
     SDSC image library IMVFBINDEX8 VFBs are written out to Apple
     pict  files  as  8-bit  color  index  images  with a CLT and
     compressed  using  Apple's  PackBits  compression.   Written
     images  are  always  type  2 pict files.  SDSC image library
     IMVFBRGB VFBs are written out to Apple pict files as  32-bit
     direct  color  images and are compressed using Apple's Pack-
     Bits compression.  Written images are  always  type  2  pict
     files.

     file writing returns the following error codes:
