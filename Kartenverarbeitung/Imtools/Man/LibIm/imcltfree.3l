NAME
     ImCltFree - free the storage for a color lookup table

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     void ImCltFree( srcClt )
          ImClt *srcClt ;


DESCRIPTION
     ImCltFree frees the dynamic storage for color  lookup  table
     _s_r_c_C_l_t.   _s_r_c_C_l_t  is  no  longer  valid  after this call and
     should not be used.

NOTES
     It is assumed that  _s_r_c_C_l_t  was  originally  allocated  with
     ImCltAlloc (3IM).

     If _s_r_c_C_l_t  is  attached  to  a  virtual  frame  buffer  (see
     ImVfbSClt  (3IM)),  it should be freed using ImCltFree prior
     to freeing the virtual frame buffer using ImVfbFree (3IM).

RETURNS
     ImCltFree returns nothing.
