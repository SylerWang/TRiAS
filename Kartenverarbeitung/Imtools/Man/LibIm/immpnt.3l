DESCRIPTION
     The MacPaint mpnt file is the standard Apple Macintosh mono-
     chrome  bitmap  image  file  format.  It can be read by many
     Macintosh graphics applications, and many Macintosh applica-
     tions  that can export bitmap graphics do so in the MacPaint
     mpnt file format.

FILE RECOGNITION
     mpnt files are recognized by these filename suffixes: .mpnt,
     .macp, and .pntg.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Apple MacPaint mpnt format
     does not require use of Apple tools or hardware and contains
     no proprietary  code.   MacPaint  mpnt  format  handling  is
     available on any machine for which the SDSC image library is
     available.

  Reading MacPaint MPNT files
     The SDSC image library reads 1-bit  MacPaint  mpnt  PackBits
     compressed  images and stores them as IMVFBMONO VFBs without
     a CLT.  MacPaint images are always 576 pixels  wide  by  720
     pixels high.

  Writing MacPaint MPNT files
     SDSC image library IMVFBMONO VFBs are written out  as  1-bit
     monochrome MacPaint mpnt images.  MacPaint images are always
     compressed  using  Apples  Macintosh  PackBits   compression
     scheme.

     The MacPaint mpnt format requires that images be exactly 576
     x  720  pixels.   If  an image to be written is smaller, the
     image will be oriented in the upper left corner of the  Mac-
     Paint  image,  and  the remainder filled with white.  If the
     image to be written is larger, the image will be clipped  to
     keep the upper left corner and warning messages output.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed  for  ImFileRead(3IM),  MacPaint
     mpnt file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed for  ImFileWrite(3IM),  MacPaint
     mpnt file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEHEIGHT   Image too tall; clipped to 720 pixels high
          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
          IMEWIDTH    Image too wide; clipped to 576 pixels wide
