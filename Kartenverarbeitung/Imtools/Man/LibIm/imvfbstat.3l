NAME
     ImVfbStat - compute image color statistics

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     float *ImVfbStat( vfb, fieldMask, stats )
          ImVfb *vfb;
          int fieldMask;
          float stats[IMMAXNUMSTATS];


DESCRIPTION
     ImVfbData computes a variety of simple statistics on  pixels
     in  the  _v_f_b.  Statistics are returned as an array of values
     in _s_t_a_t_s, a pointer to which is returned by the function.

     Statistics are computed on the single  field  of  the  image
     selected by _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k.  Legal values of _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k include:

          _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k      Meaning
8          _______________________________________________________
          IMALPHA        Compute for the alpha field
          IMMONO         Compute for the monochrome field
          IMGRAY         Compute for the grayscale field
          IMINDEX8       Compute for the index8 field
          IMINDEX16      Compute for the index16 field
8          _______________________________________________________
          IMRED          Compute for the red field
          IMGREEN        Compute for the green field
          IMBLUE         Compute for the blue field
8          _______________________________________________________
          IMHUE          Compute for the virtual hue field
          IMSATURATION   Compute for the virtual saturation field
          IMINTENSITY    Compute for the virtual intensity field

     Other VFB fields are currently not supported.

     The image must have  the  field  selected  by  _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k  or
     ImVfbStat  will  return an error.  Statistics on HSI virtual
     fields, however, may be computed for any RGB image.

     ImVfbStat computes the following statistics and returns them
     in the _s_t_a_t_s array:

          Array Index   Meaning
8          ___________________________________________
          IMMAXIMUM     Maximum field value
          IMMINIMUM     Minimum field value
          IMUNIQUEVAL   Number of unique field values

NOTES
     Additional statistics are planned for the future.  Users  of
     ImVfbStat  should  allocate  the  incomming  _s_t_a_t_s  array as

     having at least IMMAXNUMSTATS entries in  order  to  support
     future statistics and avoid core dumps.

     Extensive color usage information  may  be  had  by  calling
     ImVfbHist(3IM)  to  compute  a field histogram of the image.
     See the ImVfbHist(3IM) man page for more details.
