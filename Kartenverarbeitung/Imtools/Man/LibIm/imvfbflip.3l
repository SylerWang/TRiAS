NAME
     ImVfbFlip - Flip a virtual frame buffer vertically, horizon-
     tally, or both

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     ImVfb *ImVfbFlip( srcVfb, flipDirection, dstVfb )
          ImVfb *srcVfb ;
          int flipDirection ;
          ImVfb *dstVfb ;


DESCRIPTION
     ImVfbFlip flips a virtual frame buffer about the  horizontal
     and/or  vertical  axis  and returns a pointer to the flipped
     Vfb.

     _s_r_c_V_f_b is the Vfb to be flipped.

     _f_l_i_p_D_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n is the direction(s) about which to flip.  Pos-
     sible values for _f_l_i_p_D_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n are:

             Value          Meaning
8          _____________________________
          IMVFBXFLIP    Flip in X
          IMVFBYFLIP    Flip in Y
          IMVFBXYFLIP   Flip in X and Y

     Note that specifying IMVFBXYFLIP  causes  a  complete  pixel
     transpose.

     _d_s_t_V_f_b is the Vfb to contain the flipped image.   If  _d_s_t_V_f_b
     is  the  constant  IMVFBNEW, a new Vfb is allocated with the
     same size and the same fields as _s_r_c_V_f_b.  A pointer  to  the
     new Vfb is returned.

RETURNS
     Upon success, ImVfbDup returns a pointer to the  destination
     Vfb.  Upon failure, IMVFBNULL is returned and ImErrNo set to
     one of the following:

          IMEMALLOC    Cannot allocate enough memory for the new Vfb
          IMEBADFLIP   _f_l_i_p_D_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n is not one of the legal values
