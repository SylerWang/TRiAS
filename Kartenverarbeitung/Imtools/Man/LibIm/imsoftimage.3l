NAME
     imbmp - SoftImage Image File Format Translation

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "sdsc.h"
     #include "im.h"

     int ImFileRead( fd, "softimage", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFRead( fp, "softimage", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileWrite( fd, "softimage", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFWrite( fp, "softimage", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;


DESCRIPTION
     softimage image files are generated by SoftImage, a software
     package for Silicon Graphics computers.

     softimage files store RGB images with or  without  an  alpha
     channel.    The  data  may  be  run-length  encoded  or  not
     compressed.

FILE RECOGNITION
     softimage files are recognized  by  the  following  filename
     suffixes:   .si,  .softimage.   Although SoftImage generates
     image files with the .pic suffix,  the  SDSC  Image  library
     does  not  associate this suffix with SoftImage image files.
     (The .pic suffix is used by Pixar.)

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of  the  SoftImage  image  format
     does not require use of any softimage libraries and contains
     no proprietary  code.  SoftImage  file  format  handling  is
     available on any machine for which the SDSC image library is
     available.

  Reading SoftImage files
     The  SDSC  image  library  reads  non-compressed,  or   rle-
     compressed  24-bit  RGB  images  and stores them as IMVFBRGB
     VFB's.

  Writing Microsoft Windows BMP files
     Image library IMVFBRGB VFBs are  written  to  non-compressed
     24-bit  RGB  softimage files.  The files are compressed if a
     compression request is given in the flags table.

     Other image library VFB  types  are  converted  to  IMVFBRGB
     VFB's  prior to being written out.  See the ImFileWrite(3IM)
     man page for details.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed for  ImFileRead(3IM),  SoftImage
     file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEUNSUPPORTED   Arrangement of pixels in this file is not supported
