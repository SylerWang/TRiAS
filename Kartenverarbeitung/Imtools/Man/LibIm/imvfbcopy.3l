NAME
     ImVfbCopy - Copy a subarea within a virtual frame buffer
     ImVfbCopyChannel - Copy a single channel  from  one  vfb  to
     another

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     ImVfb *ImVfbCopy( srcVfb, srcXLeft, srcYTop, srcDX, srcDY, fieldMask, dstVfb, dstXLeft, dstYTop )
          ImVfb *srcVfb ;
          int srcXLeft, srcYTop ;
          int srcDX, srcDY ;
          int fieldMask ;
          ImVfb *dstVfb ;
          int dstXLeft, dstYTop ;

     ImVfb* ImVfbCopyChannel( inVfb, inFieldMask, outVfb, outFieldMask)
          ImVfb* inVfb;
          int inFieldMask;
          ImVfb* outVfb;
          int outFieldMask;



DESCRIPTION
     ImVfbCopy copies a portion of  a  virtual  frame  buffer  to
     another virtual frame buffer.
     A  pointer  to  the  destination  virtual  frame  buffer  is
     returned by both functions.

     _s_r_c_V_f_b is the Vfb whose subarea is to be copied.

     _s_r_c_X_L_e_f_t, _s_r_c_Y_T_o_p indicate the top-left corner of  the  area
     of the Vfb to be copied.

     _s_r_c_D_X, _s_r_c_D_Y are the dimensions of the subarea of the Vfb to
     be copied.

     _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k is a  mask  of  field  constants  (see  ImVfbAlloc
     (3IM))  that  selects the fields in _s_r_c_V_f_b to be copied into
     _d_s_t_V_f_b.

     _d_s_t_V_f_b is the Vfb to receive the copied area.

     _d_s_t_X_L_e_f_t, _d_s_t_Y_T_o_p indicate the top-left corner of  the  area
     to which the subarea will be copied.

     ImVfbCopyChannel copies one channel  of  one  virtual  frame
     buffer  to  the  desired  channel  of  another virtual frame
     buffer.
     _i_n_V_f_b is the source vfb.
     _i_n_F_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k is the channel of the  vfb  from  which  we  are

     copying.  It may be one of the following values:

          IMVFBGREY      gray channel
          IMVFBINDEX8    index channel
          IMVFBINDEX16   16-bit index channel
          IMVFBRED       red channel
          IMVFBGREEN     green channel
          IMVFBBLUE      blue channel
          IMVFBALPHA     alpha channel
          IMVFBWPROT     write protection channel
          IMVFBZ         z-buffer channel
          IMVFBIDATA     integer data channel

     _o_u_t_V_f_b is the destination vfb.
     _o_u_t_F_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k is the channel of  the  destination  vfb,  into
     which  we  are  copying.   It may take on the same values as
     inFieldMask.


NOTES
     If _d_s_t_V_f_b is the constant IMVFBNEW, a new Vfb  is  allocated
     for  the  copied  data.   The  Vfb  has the same size as the
     region being copied, and the fields are selected  by  _f_i_e_l_d_-
     _M_a_s_k.  A pointer to the new Vfb is returned.

     Portions of the copied data that  would  extend  beyond  the
     borders of the _d_s_t_V_f_b are skipped.

     The _s_r_c_V_f_b and _d_s_t_V_f_b may be the same Vfb.  The  source  and
     destination  areas  can  overlap  with  no  unpleasant  side
     effects.

RETURNS
     Upon  success,  ImVfbCopy  and  ImVfbCopyChannel  return   a
     pointer  to the destination Vfb.  Upon failure, IMVFBNULL is
     returned and ImErrNo set to the following:

          IMEMALLOC       Cannot allocate enough memory for the new Vfb
          IMENOVFB        No vfb was sent
          IMEBADCHANNEL   The incoming vfb does not have the specified channel
          IMEFIELD        The desired channel has not been allocated in the outgoing vfb
          IMEDIFFSIZE     The vfb's were different sizes
