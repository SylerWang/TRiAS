DESCRIPTION
     GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is  CompuServe's  standard
     for  generalized  color  raster  images.  This standard is a
     mechanism  to  exchange  and  display  high-quality,   high-
     resolution graphics images.

FILE RECOGNITION
     CompuServe gif files are recognized  by  the  filename  suf-
     fixes: .gif and .giff.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of CompuServe's gif  format  con-
     tains  no  proprietary code.  CompuServe gif format handling
     is available on any machine for which the SDSC image library
     is available.

  Reading CompuServe GIF files
     The  SDSC  image  library  reads  LZW   (Limpel-Ziv   Welsh)
     compressed  color  index  images  with depths of 1 through 8
     bits, with or without a CLT.  1-bit  images  are  stored  as
     IMVFBMONO  VFBs,  while  2- through 8-bit color index images

IMGIF(3IM)             SDSC IMAGE LIBRARY              IMGIF(3IM)



     are stored as IMVFBINDEX8 VFBs.

     If the gif file contains multiple images, multiple VFBs  are
     created  and  appended  to  the  _d_a_t_a_T_a_b_l_e.   The SDSC image
     library reads both gif 87a and gif 89a.

  Writing CompuServe GIF files
     SDSC  image  library  IMVFBMONO  VFBs  are  written  as  LZW
     compressed 1-bit images, with or without a CLT.  IMVFBINDEX8
     VFBs are written as LZW compressed  8-bit  images,  with  or
     without a CLT.

     Other image library VFB types are converted to IMVFBMONO  or
     IMVFBINDEX8  VFBs  prior  to  being  written  out.   See the
     ImFileWrite(3IM) man  page  for  details.   The  SDSC  image
     library writes only gif 87a files.  This allows maximum por-
     tability of the file, since gif 89a decoders can  also  read
     gif 87a.

     The gif format can support multiple images in a single file,
     with  the  restriction  that  all  such images have the same
     depth.  The SDSC image library currently  does  not  support
     storage of more than one image in a single gif file.

     The SDSC image library supports writing  of  a  transparency
     field to a gif file.  This field is used by programs such as
     netscape to determine which index value shall be  considered
     transparent.   You  may  request  image transparency via the
     flags table by adding an entry  to  the  flags  table  named
     "image  transparency  request".   The  value associated with
     this entry should be a character string in one of  the  fol-
     lowing forms:
     "most common"   Select the most common index value as transparent
     "rgb=r g b"     Select pixels with r red, g green, b blue as transparent
     "index=i"       Select pixels with index value i as transparent.

     gif file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
