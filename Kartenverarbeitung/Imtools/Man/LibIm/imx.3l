NAME
     imx - AVS X file translation

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "sdsc.h"
     #include "im.h"

     int ImFileRead( fd, "x", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFRead( fp, "x", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileWrite( fd, "x", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFWrite( fp, "x", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;


DESCRIPTION
     x image files are generated  by  Stardent  Computer,  Inc.'s
     Application  Visualization  System (AVS).  See the AVS docu-
     mentation set for details on how to use these tools.

FILE RECOGNITION
     AVS x files are recognized by the  following  filename  suf-
     fixes:  .x and .avs.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the  AVS  x  format  does  not
     require  use  of any AVS tools or Stardent hardware and con-
     tains no proprietary code.  AVS x format handling is  avail-
     able  on  any  machine  for  which the SDSC image library is
     available.

  Reading AVS X files
     The SDSC image library  reads  uncompressed,  noninterlaced,
     32-bit  RGB-Alpha  AVS  x files and maps them to (IMVFBRGB |
     IMVFBALPHA) VFBs without color lookup tables (CLTs).

  Writing AVS X files
     Image library IMVFBRGB and (IMVFBRGB | IMVFBALPHA) VFBs  are

     written to uncompressed, noninterlaced, 32-bit RGB-Alpha AVS
     x files.  The AVS x format does not  support  scanline-  and
     plane-interlaced modes.

     Other image library VFB types are converted to IMVFBRGB VFBs
     prior  to  being written out.  See the ImFileWrite (3IM) man
     page for details.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed for ImFileRead (3IM), AVS x file
     reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed for  ImFileWrite  (3IM),  AVS  x
     file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
