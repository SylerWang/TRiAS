DESCRIPTION
     synu is the image file format output by  SDSC's  synu  (Syn-
     thetic Universe) portable renderer.

FILE RECOGNITION
     synu files are recognized only  by  the  following  filename
     suffix: .synu

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the SDSC synu format does  not
     require  use  of  any  other  SDSC  tools  and  contains  no
     proprietary code.  SDSC synu format handling is available on
     any machine for which the SDSC image library is available.

     synu files contain "objects" of many types, such  as  grays-
     cale  images,  RGB  images,  and  various forms of geometry.
     SDSC image library translation of synu files is  limited  to
     the  handling  of grayscale and RGB objects.  All other synu
     objects are ignored during reads  and  cannot  be  generated
     during writes.

  Reading Synu files
     The SDSC image library reads one or  more  uncompressed,  8-

     bit,  grayscale and 24-bit, RGB synu images and maps them to
     IMVFBINDEX8 and IMVFBRGB VFBs,  respectively,  both  without
     color lookup tables.

  Writing Synu files
     Image library IMVFBINDEX8 VFBs without color  lookup  tables
     are  written  as  8-bit grayscale synu files.  IMVFBRGB VFBs
     without color lookup tables are written as 24-bit  RGB  synu
     files.   Both image types are uncompressed.   RGB images are
     noninterlaced.  Scanline- and plane-interlaced modes are not
     supported by synu image files.

     Other image library VFB types are converted  to  IMVFBINDEX8
     or  IMVFBRGB VFBs without color lookup tables prior to being
     written out.  See the ImFileWrite(3IM) man page for details.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed for ImFileRead(3IM),  synu  file
     reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed for ImFileWrite(3IM), synu  file
     writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
