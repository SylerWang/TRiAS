DESCRIPTION
     iff image files  are  generated  by  Sun  Microsystems  TAAC
     software  such  as  voxvu(1) and cloudvu(1).  See the _T_A_A_C-_1
     _A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n  _A_c_c_e_l_e_r_a_t_o_r:  _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e  _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  _M_a_n_u_a_l   for
     information on how to use these programs.

     Note that image files compressed with the  Sun-TAAC  utility
     make_movie(1) cannot be read by the SDSC image library.

FILE RECOGNITION
     iff files are recognized by the following  filename  suffix:
     .iff, .vff, .suniff, .taac.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Sun-TAAC iff  format  does
     not  require  use of Sun-TAAC tools or hardware and contains
     no proprietary code.  Sun-TAAC iff format handling is avail-
     able  on  any  machine  for  which the SDSC image library is
     available.

  Reading Sun-TAAC IFF files
     The SDSC image library reads unencoded, non-interlaced,  24-
     bit  RGB  and  32-bit RGB+Alpha Sun-TAAC iff file images and

     maps them  to  IMVFBRGB  or  (IMVFBRGB  |  IMVFBALPHA)  VFBs
     without CLTs.

     The library reads unencoded, 8-bit color index Sun-TAAC  iff
     images  with  CLTs  and  maps  them to IMVFBINDEX8 VFBs with
     CLTs.  Note that color index  images  never  have  an  alpha
     plane.

  Writing Sun-TAAC IFF files
     The SDSC image  library  writes  IMVFBRGB  and  (IMVFBRGB  |
     IMVFBALPHA)  VFBs to unencoded, non-interlaced 24-bit RGB or
     32-bit RGB+Alpha Sun-TAAC iff files.  Scanline-  and  plane-
     interlaced modes are not available in iff files.

     The image library writes IMVFBINDEX8 VFBs with CLTs as unen-
     coded,  8-bit  color  index images with CLTs in Sun-TAAC iff
     files.

     Other image library VFB types are converted to  IMVFBRGB  or
     IMVFBINDEX8  VFBs  prior  to  being  written  out.   See the
     ImFileWrite(3IM) man page for details.

     iff does not support any form of image compression.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed  for  ImFileRead(3IM),  Sun-TAAC
     iff file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEDEPTH    Unknown image depth
          IMEFORMAT   Bad format
          IMEMAGIC    Bad magic number
          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation
          IMESYNTAX   Syntax error

     In addition to those listed for  ImFileWrite(3IM),  Sun-TAAC
     iff file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
