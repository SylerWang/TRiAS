NAME
     imrgb - Silicon Graphics RGB file translation

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "sdsc.h"
     #include "im.h"

     int ImFileRead( fd, "rgb", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFRead( fp, "rgb", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileWrite( fd, "rgb", flagsTable, dataTable )
          int         fd;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;

     int ImFileFWrite( fp, "rgb", flagsTable, dataTable )
          FILE         *fp;
          TagTable   *flagsTable;
          TagTable   *dataTable;


DESCRIPTION
     rgb image files are generated  by  Silicon  Graphics,  Inc.,
     software  such  as icut(1) and snapshot(1).  See the Silicon
     Graphics documentation for information on how to  use  these
     and other Silicon Graphics programs.

FILE RECOGNITION
     Silicon Graphics rgb files are recognized by  the  following
     filename suffixes:  .rgb, .iris, and .sgi.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Silicon Graphics rgb  for-
     mat  does not require use of any Silicon Graphics library or
     hardware and contains no proprietary code. Silicon  Graphics
     rgb  format  handling  is available on any machine for which
     the SDSC image library is available.

  Reading Silicon Graphics RGB files
     The SDSC image library  reads  uncompressed  and  runlength-
     encoded  (RLE) 8-bit grayscale and 24-bit RGB Silicon Graph-
     ics rgb images and stores  them  as  IMVFBRGB  VFBs  without
     CLTs.

  Writing Silicon Graphics RGB files
     Image library IMVFBRGB VFBs are written to  uncompressed  or
     runlength-encoded  8-bit  grayscale  and  24-bit RGB Silicon
     Graphics  rgb  files.   Noninterlaced  and  plane-interlaced
     modes are not available in the Silicon Graphics rgb format.

     Other image library VFB types are converted to IMVFBRGB VFBs
     prior  to  being  written out.  See the ImFileWrite(3IM) man
     page for details.

ERRORS
     In addition to those  listed  for  ImFileRead(3IM),  Silicon
     Graphics rgb file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEDEPTH    Image depth not supported
          IMEMAGIC    Bad magic number in header
          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMEPLANES   Number of bytes per plane not supported
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed  for  ImFileWrite(3IM),  Silicon
     Graphics rgb file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEDEPTH    Image depth not supported
          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
