DESCRIPTION
     icon image files are used by Sun Microsystem's SunView  win-
     dow  system,  NeWS window system, OpenWindows NeWS tool set,
     and X11 XView tool set for the storage  of  icons,  cursors,
     fill  patterns,  and  pieces  of widgets (like button check-
     marks).

     Sun icon files can be  most  easily  generated  using  Sun's
     iconedit(1)  icon and cursor editor.  The Sun operating sys-
     tem release includes a directory of standard icons, cursors,
     background patterns, and widget pieces in icon format in the
     directory /usr/include/images.  See  the  Sun  documentation
     set  for  details  on  how to use the tools dealing with Sun
     icon files.

FILE RECOGNITION
     Sun icon files are recognized by  these  filename  suffixes:
     .icon, .cursor, and .pr.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Sun icon format  does  not
     require  use  of  Sun  libraries and contains no proprietary
     code.  Sun icon format handling is available on any  machine

IMICON(3IM)            SDSC IMAGE LIBRARY             IMICON(3IM)



     for which the SDSC image library is available.

     icon files contain a C-language array initialization  start-
     ing with a comment header giving the width and height of the
     icon, followed by ASCII hex data giving the  icon's  bitmap.
     For example,

          /* Format_version=1, Width=16, Height=16, Depth=1, Valid_bits_per_item=16
           */
                  0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x6200,0x920C,0x1392,0x7250,
                  0x9252,0x7B8C,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000

     Format_version must be 1; there are  no  other  versions  at
     this time.

     Width and Height are the width and height of  the  icon,  in
     pixels.  Sun's iconedit(1) tool requires that the icon width
     be a multiple of 16.  The SDSC image library similarly  con-
     strains  the  icon  width for consistency with Sun tools and
     common usage.

     Depth must be 1; there are no other depths in common use.

     Valid_bits_per_item must be 16; there are no other sizes  in
     common use.

     Icon pixel data is given immediately following  the  comment
     header.   Monochrome  pixels are packed 16 to an integer and
     written out as a string of 4 hex characters.  Image data  is
     given  from left to right, top to bottom.  Values are comma-
     separated.

  Reading Sun ICON files
     The SDSC image library reads Sun icon bitmaps and maps  them
     to IMVFBMONO VFBs without color lookup tables (CLTs).

  Writing Sun ICON files
     The SDSC image library writes IMVFBMONO  VFBs  as  Sun  icon
     bitmaps.

     Other image library VFB types  are  converted  to  IMVFBMONO
     VFBs  prior  to being written out.  See the ImFileWrite(3IM)
     man page for details.

     Image width and height fields  in  the  comment  header  are
     based on the VFB's width and height.  Image width is rounded
     up to the next multiple of 16 bits.  If  padding  is  neces-
     sary, pad bits are set to 0 (white).

     _W_a_r_n_i_n_g:  The Sun icon editor iconedit(1)  was  designed  to
     edit  small  bitmaps, like icons and cursors.  Consequently,
     it tends to have severe difficulty with large bitmaps,  such

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed for  ImFileRead(3IM),  Sun  icon
     file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYNTAX   Syntax error in parsing icon file
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed for ImFileWrite(3IM),  Sun  icon
     file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
