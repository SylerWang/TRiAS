NAME
     ImFileQFormat, ImFileQFFormat - query file's image format

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     char *ImFileQFormat( fd, fileName )
          int fd;
          char *fileName;

     char *ImFileQFFormat( fp, fileName )
          FILE *fp;
          char *fileName;

     ImFileFormat** ImFileFindFormat(name)
          char* name;

     char *ImFileQCompression( fd, fileName )
          int fd;
          char *fileName;

     char *ImFileQFCompression( fp, fileName )
          FILE *fp;

          char* name;



DESCRIPTION
     ImFileQFormat and ImFileQFFormat determine  the  image  file
     format  in  use  by the stream selected by _f_d or _f_p, respec-
     tively.  The name of the format is returned.
     ImFileFindFormat returns a pointer to a pointer to the  file
     format  structure corresponding to _n_a_m_e.   If _n_a_m_e is not in
     the format table, then it returns NULL.

     ImFileQCompression  and  ImFileQFCompression  determine  the
     compression scheme (if any) in use by the stream selected by
     _f_d or _f_p, respectively.  If the stream  is  compressed,  the
     name   of  the  scheme  is  returned.   Otherwise,  NULL  is
     returned.
     ImFileFindCompressionScheme returns a pointer to an entry in
     the compression scheme table corresponding to _n_a_m_e.

NOTES
     If the stream is a pipe or device,  or  a  file  opened  for
     writing,  the stream is left untouched with no data read in.
     The input's image file format is determined by matching  the
     _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e  extension  (characters after the last "." in name)
     against a list of formats supported by  the  image  library.

     If no match is found, a NULL character string is returned by
     both functions.

     If the stream is a file opened for reading, data is read  in
     and checked against a list of magic numbers for schemes sup-
     ported by the image library.  If  no  match  is  found,  the
     _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e  extension  is  checked,  as above.  If no match is
     found here either, a NULL character string  is  returned  by
     both  functions.   In any case, the stream is reset to point
     to the first byte of the file.

     If a match is found, a character pointer to the name of  the
     matched  image  file  format  is  returned as the function's
     value.  The returned pointer points to internal table  space
     that should not be modified by the user.

RETURNS
     Upon success, the name of the format used by the  stream  is
     returned.   On failure, a NULL character pointer is returned
     and IImErrNo set to

          IMESYS             System call error
          IMEFORMATUNKNOWN   Unknown image file format
