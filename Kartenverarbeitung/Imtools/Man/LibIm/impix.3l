DESCRIPTION
     pix image files are generated by the rendering and  painting
     tools  of Alias Research, Inc., such as renderer, raytracer,
     and paint.  See the Alias documentation set for  details  on
     how to use these tools.

     _N_o_t_e: Alias quickpaint, available on Silicon Graphics, Inc.,
     IRIS  workstations,  uses  Silicon  Graphic's rgb image file
     format rather than the Alias pix image file format.  See the
     imrgb(3IM) man page for details on the rgb format.

FILE RECOGNITION
     Alias pix files are recognized by these  following  filename
     suffixes: .alias and .pix.

NOTES
     SDSC image library support of the Alias pix format does  not
     require use of Alias tools and contains no proprietary code.
     Alias pix format handling is available on  any  machine  for
     which the SDSC image library is available.

  Reading Alias PIX files
     The  SDSC  image  library  reads  run-length-encoded  (RLE),

     noninterlaced,  24-bit  RGB Alias pix files and maps them to
     IMVFBRGB VFBs without color lookup tables (CLTs).   It  also
     reads Alias mask files, which are 8-bit greyscale files.

  Writing Alias PIX files
     Image library  IMVFBRGB  VFBs  are  written  to  run-length-
     encoded,   noninterlaced,   24-bit   RGB  Alias  pix  files.
     IMVFBGREY files are written to 8-bit Alias mask files.

     Other image library VFB types are converted to IMVFBRGB VFBs
     prior  to  being  written out.  See the ImFileWrite(3IM) man
     page for details.

ERRORS
     In addition to those listed for ImFileRead(3IM),  Alias  pix
     file reading returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in read operation

     In addition to those listed for ImFileWrite(3IM), Alias  pix
     file writing returns the following error codes:

          IMEMALLOC   Cannot allocate enough memory
          IMESYS      System call error in write operation
