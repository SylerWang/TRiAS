NAME
     ImVfbMix - Combine any of the fields in  two  virtual  frame
     buffers by a certain weighting factor
     ImVfbFade - Fade the pixels in a vfb towards zero.

SYNOPSIS
     #include "im.h"

     ImVfbMix( src1Vfb, src1Weight, src2Vfb, src2Weight, fieldMask, dstVfb )
             ImVfb *src1Vfb;
             float  src1Weight;
             ImVfb *src2Vfb;
             float  src2Weight;
             int    fieldMask;
             ImVfb *dstVfb;

     ImVfbFade( srcVfb, srcWeight, fieldMask, dstVfb )
          ImVfb *srcVfb;
          double srcWeight;
          int fieldMask;
          ImVfb *dstVfb;


DESCRIPTION
     ImVfbMix combines any fields (one or more)  of  two  virtual
     frame  buffers  by  multiplying  src1Vfb  by  src1Weight and
     adding it to src2Vfb times src2Weight this  result  is  then
     stored in the dstVfb, a pointer to which is returned.

     ImVfbFade fades any fields of a virtual frame buffer towards
     zero.   That is, all pixels in the specified fields are mul-
     tiplied by _s_r_c_W_e_i_g_h_t.

     _s_r_c_1_V_f_b is the Vfb to take one set of values to combine into
     the dstVfb.

     _s_r_c_1_W_e_i_g_h_t is the weight to multiply it by.

     _s_r_c_1_V_f_b is the Vfb to take one set of values to combine into
     the dstVfb.

     _s_r_c_1_W_e_i_g_h_t is the weight to multiply it by.

     _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k is the mask which tells what fields to fill.  Pos-
     sible values for _f_i_e_l_d_M_a_s_k are:

          IMVFBFDATA     Fill the floating point field
          IMVFBALL       Fill all the fields
          IMVFBWPROT     Fill the write protect field
          IMVFBZ         Fill the zbuffer field
          IMVFBALPHA     Fill the alpha field
          IMVFBINDEX8    Fill the index8 field
          IMVFBINDEX16   Fill the index16 field
          IMVFBMONO      Fill the mono field

     Note that any combination of these can  be  used  to  change
     multiple fields.

     _d_s_t_V_f_b is the Vfb to contain the new image.   If  _d_s_t_V_f_b  is
     the  constant IMVFBNEW, a new Vfb is allocated with the same
     size and the same fields as _s_r_c_V_f_b.  A pointer  to  the  new
     Vfb is returned.

RETURNS
     Upon success, ImVfbMix returns a pointer to the  destination
     Vfb.
