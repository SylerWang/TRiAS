    Windows Build
    -------------

Most of the notes in the README apply on Windows as well; however, to 
configure and build follow the following steps:

 o Edit makefile.vc, updating the TIFF_LIB and TIFF_INC variables to point
   to the location of the tiff include files, and library.  

 o Build using the command ``nmake -f makefile.vc''
