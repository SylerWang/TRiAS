4.  Image Library Functions.

Release 3.0 includes a function library providing features for image  mani-
pulation  and image file format I/O.  Library calls may be made from K&R C,
ANSI C, or C++.  A complete list of library functionality  is  provided  in
the imintro(3IM) man page.

Source code and man pages for all library functions are included.



5.  Documentation

Man pages are included that describe the tools, library functions, and  all
supported  image  file  formats.  nroff source is provided in files with .n
filename suffixes and should be processed through tbl and nroff.  For exam-
ple:

     tbl imconv.n | nroff -man > imconv.1l
             or
     tbl imtiff.n | nroff -man > imtiff.3l
             or
     tbl imintro.n | nroff -man > imintro.3l

A Makefile is provided to build man pages using nroff and tbl.

For sites without access to nroff and tbl, post-processed text versions  of
all man pages are included in files with .1l and .3l filename suffixes.

For sites with PostScript laserprinters, PostScript versions of the  manual
pages are provided in files with .ps filename suffixes.



6.  Binary and Source Releases

Release 3.0 of the SDSC Image Tools is available as both a  binary  release
for  selected  architectures,  and  a  full  source  code  release.  Binary



                              October 3, 1995





                                   - 4 -


releases are available for the following architectures:


     Cray Research Inc.        C-90 supercomputers, UNICOS
     Digital Equipment Corp.   Alpha workstations, OSF/1
     Silicon Graphics Inc.     R3000 and R4000 workstations, IRIX 5.x and IRIX 6.x
     Sun Microsystems Inc.     SPARC workstations, SunOS


The same source code has been built and verified  on  additional  architec-
tures, including the following:


     Alliant Computer Systems   FX/80 and FX/2800 minisupercomputers
     Cray Research Inc.         X-MP and Y-MP supercomputers, UNICOS
     Digital Equipment Corp.    DECStation workstations, ULTRIX
     Digital Equipment Corp.    DEC VAX and VAXStation workstations, ULTRIX
     IBM                        RS/6000 workstations, AIX
     NeXT Computers             NeXTStation workstations
     Sun Microsystems Inc.      Sun3 workstations


We believe that the source code is  fully  portable  to  32-bit  or  64-bit
architectures of any byte order or word size.

Use of the SDSC Image Tools library requires  the  companion  SDSC  Utility
Library libsdsc.a.  libsdsc.a includes C packages to handle portable binary
I/O, command-line argument parsing, and the tag table data  structure  used
by  the  SDSC  Image Tools.  The SDSC Utility Library and its documentation
may be separately uploaded via anonymous ftp from ftp.sdsc.edu.



7.  Changes since the last release

The SDSC Image Tools have been expanded to include a variety of new library
routines  and  command-line  tools, as well as support for additional image
file formats and additional variants of previously supported file formats.

7.1.  Image Tools.

New Tools:

     o+imdissolve.  Dissolve two images together.

     o+imkey.  Composite one image atop another by keying  on  fields  of  a
      foreground image.

     o+imlighten.  Lighten or darken an image.

     o+imstoryboard.  Create a storyboard grid of images.

Tool Enhancements:




                              October 3, 1995





                                   - 5 -


     o+all tools.  Changed the method of selecting the format  for  a  file.
      Instead of -ras, -gif, or -tiff, we now use -informat ras, -outformat
      gif flags to more clearly choose the format to use for input or  out-
      put files.

     o+all tools.  Added support for file compression.  A specific  compres-
      sion  scheme  may be specified using the -infilecompression and -out-
      filecompression options.

     o+all tools.  Added help for individual flags.   For  instance,  imcomp
      -help -over gives you help on what the -over option on imcomp does.

     o+all tools.  Added the capability to permute channels when reading  or
      writing a file.  For instance, imconv -inmap red=blue -inmap blue=red
      infile.ras outfile.ras will switch the red and the blue  channels  in
      your image immediately after reading it in.

     o+all tools.  Added -outtransparency,  -outtransparencyrgb,  and  -out-
      transparencyindex options for specifying a transparency color for GIF
      and XPM images.

     o+all tools.  Added the -outquality option to specify  the  quality  of
      compression for JPEG images.

     o+all tools.  Added the -outgroup option to  select  whether  to  group
      pixels by scanlines or tiles for TIFF images.

     o+all tools.  Added the -inpagewidth, -inpageheight, and -indpi options
      to select the width, height, and dpi for PostScript images rasterized
      by GhostScript (available from Gnu).

     o+all  tools.   Added  values  for  -outcompress   to   support   ASCII
      uncompressed  output  (for  PBM images) and discrete cosine transform
      compression (for JPEG and TIFF images).

     o+imadjust.  Added the capability to adjust monochrome, write  protect,
      Z-buffer, integer data, and floating point data fields.

     o+imcomp.  Added the -inalpha option  to  use  an  alpha  channel  from
      another file when compositing.  Using this option with the inalphamap
      option will allow you to specify which  channel  of  the  input  file
      should be considered the alpha channel.

     o+immono.  Added the -dither option to do Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

Tool Compression Schemes:
     All tools now recognize compressed files and automatically compress or
     decompress  if  you have the compression/decompression tools installed
     from Gnu or your computer manufacturer.   Compression  schemes  recog-
     nized include:

     o+Z.  Lempel-Ziv Encoding (UNIX compress/uncompress).

     o+z.  Huffman encoding (UNIX pack/unpack).



                              October 3, 1995





                                   - 6 -


     o+gz.  Gnu Lempel-Ziv Encoding (Gnu gzip/gunzip).

     o+uu.  UU Encoding (UNIX uuencode/uudecode).

Tool Bug Fixes:

     o+imadjust.  Fixed problems with ramping of hue, saturation, and inten-
      sity.

     o+imcat.  Fixed problems with  reading  from  stdin,  and  use  of  the
      -frames option.

     o+imcopy.  Fixed handling of multi-image files.

     o+imadjust.  Fixed problems with ramping of hue, saturation, and inten-

      Also fixed problems with ramping of hue, saturation, and intensity.

Functions removed from imtools.c:

     o+ImToolsBuildFlagsTable.  This function created a single  flags  table
      for  all  incoming  or  outgoing image files.  There are now separate
      flags tables for each incoming and outgoing file.

Functions added to imtools.c:

     o+ImToolsMakeStandardFlagsTable.  Make a standard flags table.

     o+ImToolsAddReadWriteflags.  Add the reading and writing flags  to  the
      flags table.

8.  Items that may cause confusion

The following features of the SDSC Image Tools may confuse some users.

     o+IFF format files are Sun's TAAC images, not Amiga images.   Both  Sun
      and Commodore used the same mnemonic for their image files.

     o+PICT handles PICT2 as well.

     o+PICT files are always mapped to RGB images during  conversion.   This
      is  an artifact made necessary by support of multi-image, multi-color
      map features of the PICT and PICT2 formats.  A command line like  the
      following  will  result  in  an  RGB HDF file instead of the expected
      color index HDF file:
9                           imconv image.pict image.hdf

     o+PICT support does not handle many drawing operations.  To do so would
      require  reimplementing  Apple's QuickDraw and is beyond the scope of


9                              October 3, 1995





                                   - 9 -


      an image handling package.  PICT files containing drawing  operations
      should be converted to bitmaps on the Macintosh, then uploaded to the
      UNIX host.  Bitmap conversion may be accomplished with a  variety  of
      tools, including SuperPaint, PhotoShop, and others.

     o+PICT support does not handle fonts.   Text  stored  in  a  PICT  file
      references  a  font,  but  does  not include the font's bitmap.  When
      uploaded to a UNIX host, the font bitmaps are  no  longer  available.
      This makes it impossible to support PICT text operations.  PICT files
      containing text should be converted to bitmaps on the Macintosh, then
      uploaded  to  the  UNIX  host.  Bitmap conversion may be accomplished
      with a variety of tools, including SuperPaint, PhotoShop, and others.

     o+Wavefront RLA handles RLB as well.

     o+The Image Tools support PostScript and EPS  image  writing  directly.
      To  read PostScript and EPS files, the Image Tools invoke GhostScript
      if you have it installed.



9.  Known Problems

The following are known problems present in the 3.0  release  of  the  SDSC
Image Tools:

     o+XWD files stored in the XY format (instead of Z format) are not  sup-
      ported yet.



10.  Bug Reports and User Registration

This software is developed and supported by  the  San  Diego  Supercomputer
Center, and we want to hear from you.  If you find bugs (heaven forbid), or
want to be put on our mailing list for  future  software  releases,  please
fill  out  and  send  us a bug report and/or user registration form.  These
forms may be obtained by executing any one of our tools with the  -feedback
or -register options.

For instance, to generate a bug report feedback form for imconv, type:

     % imconv -feedback

The feedback (bug report) form is written to a file named  imconv.fbk.0  in
the  current  directory.   When generating a feedback form, the tool writes
the form and exits without executing further.

To generate a user registration form for imconv, type:

     % imconv -register

Like the feedback form, the registration form is written to  a  file  named
imconv.reg.0  in  the  current  directory.   When generating a registration

form, the tool writes the form and exits without executing further.

User registration is not required, but we'd like to hear from  you  anyway.
We'll put you on a mailing list for notification of future releases of SDSC
software tools, and read with interest who you are and what you  are  doing
with our software.

After you have filled out the form, please send the form,  and  any  accom-
panying data, source fragments, sample output, or whatever, to SDSC:
