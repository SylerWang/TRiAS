TRiAS V5.10

Known issues:
- Finish extended legend configuration.
- Finish saving and loading of object collections.
- Drag&drop between two ORWnd's should incorporate only the two windows involved.
- Implement document linking (extended bilder.ext).

- Object oriented visualisation doesn't work for object collections with
  more than 32000 objects (2^15-1).
- ODBC search dialog doesn't work for the demo project.
- Colored TIFF's which are to be visualised in grayscale don't print grayscale.


V5.10.1510
- Fixed problem with EDBS import, where unknown EDBS foils didn't get imported
  under certain circumstances.

V5.10.1509
- Fixed a bug in the Basic interface, where GeoObject::GetObjectsInRect wrongly
  handled the coordinates.
- Added Lead Tools TIFF handling of raster images.

Fri Dec 3 14:00:00 2004 (V5.10.1505)
- Fixed another possible problem during printing of background images.
- Fixed problems with printing backgrund images in Bitterfeld.
- Finished the new Users Manual.
- Fixed a serious bug in the database access code, which lead to trashed database
  files (under rare circumstances).
- Added the possibility to make color images transparent (just as monochrom images).
  Note, that this was impemented for palettezised images only).
- Applied the newest patch for the LeadTools Raster Imaging Toolkit.
- Replaced drawing code for background TIF and BMP images with code based on the 
  LeadToolkit (now all kinds of TIF and BMP related formats are supported correctly).
- Corrected the installation to contain the new LeadTools DLL's needed for 
  the image drawing code.
- Fixed a problem in the topological relations module, which reported an illegal 
  parameter for each analysed object.
- Moved TRiAS-MapInfo dataserver to the newest version of the mitab library (V1.3.0).

Tue Nov 16 11:10:22 2004 (V5.10.1502)
- Added AreasToLines and LinesToAreas components.
- Fixed a memory corruption bug, when TRiAS was started with a database name
  not containing the *.ris file extension.
- Fixed a bug, where menu entries in the ORMenu were truncated.
- Fixed an error reporting bug in fakemfc.ext, when a datasource couldn't be
  opened.
- Added a new extension (loadablecommands.ext), updated build process and 
  installation.
- Moved the Loadable command menu command into a separate extension 
  (loadablecommands.ext). Implemented the same command for the ORWnds.
- Fixed a nasty bug in the new statistics extension, whichlead to crashs when opening
  the object property tree.
- Fixed a message handling bug for tree controls in the CommonView Framework libraries.
- Tried to fix image painting problems in the karten.vmd module.
- Fixed a bug in the searchwindow code, which reported a bad object type for a
  window entry under certain circumstances.
- Added statistics page for search windows.
- Fixed a couple of build bugs, added automatical TRiAS Version string generation for
  the build process (as an environment variable).

Wed Nov 10 21:50:00 MET 2004 (V5.10.1496)
- Fixed a header inconsistency, where the TRiASHP used another shapelib.h as
  the underlying shapelib.lib.
- Moved the complete development environment into a VMWare virtual machine.

V5.10.1493
- Changed the way, how topologigal relations are calculated for objects with
  geometrical inconsistencies from write ptotected datasources. These are now
  corrected on the fly, so that the analysis doesn't fail anymore for objects
  with correctable inconsistencies.
- Fixed a registration problem in BNA-import which occured on WindowsMe only.
- Fixed a coordinate system loading problem, which occured on WindowsMe only.
- Allowed to open very old TRiAS databases in read only mode.

Wed Jun 9 21:08:23 WEDT 2004 (V5.10.1488)
- Fixed a problem in Abstand::ShiftedLinePart, which calculated a negative smallest 
  distance usable as the shift offset. Added shift forcing through, when an error 
  handler is installed and returns EC_OKAY.
- Fixed object count for non-TRiAS datasources.
- Added BesD to the list of known datasource coordsystems.
- Changed coordsystem initialisation to try to load from file first.
- Refined error handling for shape datasource open errors.
- Fixed a problem with geodetic coordinate systems (unit degree), when used as the
  project coordinate system.
- Fixed a bug, which prevented to correctly save the ODBC connection information, 
  if the related object property was the ObjektName and it was subsequently 
  renamed.
- Fixed coordinate display for geodetical coordinates, when the project coordinate
  system was set to use degrees.
- Fixed several bugs in the ODBC-connectivity extension, ensuring the correct
  existence of all related object properties.
- Optimized ASC-import when requested to not import geometries.
- Optimized creation of object windows, whenever several large object groups 
  were to be put into one output window.

Sun May 23 16:09:50 WEDT 2004 (V5.10.1484)
- Statistical object properties were available only after opening first object
  window.
- Generate object properties had several problems, when only output of the 
  cumulated values were requested.
- After making dadasource name unique (while adding a new or existing datasource)
  the Next button was grayed.
- Wrong icon for ArcView datasources was shown in statistics window.
- Fixed several problems with (un-)registering extensions introduced recently.

Sun May  9 10:18:26  2004 (V5.10.1482)
- Hidden PolyGIS-DAT Import and PolyGIS PMF/DAT export behind the corresponding 
  license flag (GCO Produktion).
- Renamed PolyGISBNA into AtlasGIS BNA :-).
- PolyGIS image support is always enabled now :-).

Sat May  8 18:56:14  2004
- Fixed a problem in Toporel, which prevented the main toporel wizard to show.
- Applied late fixes in GeoEdit, made by Wolfgang (fixes for CommonBorder).
- Added CoordSysSelect for BNA data import too. 
- Changed Toporel to show the second selection dialog for the ORWnd's only
  if appropriate.
- Fixed drag&drop between two ORWnd's. Changed corresponding menutexts to be
  more instructive.
- Fixed SelfromORWnd to force full reload of the PropertySequence if the
  show state is changed from the last instantiation in the current context.

Fri May 7 (V5.10.1480)
- Added CoordSysSelect for data import.
- Removed sound during startup dialog.
- Added License warning, if user upgraded to V5.10 (needs new license key).

Tue May  4 20:57:00  2004
- Added ability to all import extensions to specify the coordinate system
  for the imported geometry.
- Added CoordSysSelect for data export.
- Added permanently ObjPropSelect for data export (Version > 5.1).
- Neue Lizenierungscodes für Version > 5.1. 
- Fixed a bug, which prevented to show the correct icon for ArcView
  datasource during data export.
- Fixed a lot of license strings in different resources.

Sun May  2 16:24:27  2004

Sat May  1 16:42:38  2004
- Bug fixed in Topologische Relationen, welcher bewirkte, dass überlappende 
  Objekte am linken und unteren Containerrand des Bezugobjektes als außerhalb
  gefunden wurden.
- Text Legende --> Zeichenerklärung in verschiedenen Resourcen.

2003
- Redone Topologische Relationen
