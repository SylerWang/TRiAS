This directory contains a collection of test programs and a Perl
script, runtests.pl, that runs them all in an orderly fashion.

runtests.pl considers a test to have failed if it either:
(a) sees the string "failed" somewhere in the output of the test program.
(b) finds a that core file appeared after the test program was run.

The script traps and buffers a test programs output.  In the event of
failure, it spews all of the program's output to stdout.

Test programs are given names like test_Xnnn, where X is a category
code and nnn is a test number.  Category codes are capital letters,
and the category assigned to the test should (more or less) indicate
which chunk of Goose's functionality is being tested.

Here is how we assign category codes to various Goose-isms:

A = Vectors, Matrices, Permutations
B = Special Functions
E = RealSets and Other Containers
F = General Statistics
G = Regression
H = Bootstrapping

BTW, runtests.pl actually reads this file.  You might want to avoid
changing it in strange ways.
