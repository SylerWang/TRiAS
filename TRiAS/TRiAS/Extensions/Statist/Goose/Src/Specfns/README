I've butchered the probability function part of the cephes library by:

(a) Turning everything into a C++ program.  Besides just changing the file
    extensions, I had to change all of the function definitions from old
    K&R "int foo(x,y) int x, y;" style over to ANSI "int foo(int x, int y)"
    style.  Hadn't seen one of those K&R-type ones for quite a while...

(b) Horror of horrors, took the cephes mtherr function and replace it with
    something that throws a MathException.

(c) Removed a lot of function prototypes inside the code itself.  Created a
    new specfns_protos.h file for all of the public functions.  Added some
    prototypes to mconf.h for "private" functions.

(d) Added the factorial, log_factorial, choose, and log_choose functions.

(e) Took out a few things, like the random # generator.

(f) Turned the polynomial evaluation routines into inline functions, 
    moved them from their own source file into mconf.h.

(g) Added "verbose names" for many of the functions in specfns.h.

(h) Took some unused stuff out.  (Mostly things relating to other pieces of
    cephes.)

Apologies to Stephen L. Moshier, the Copyright holder, for trampling
all over his source code.
