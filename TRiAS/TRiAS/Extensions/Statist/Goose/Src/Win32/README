Goose and Win32
---------------

The goose library compiles on Windows using the 
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.  

It's now possible to use the library in other projects.
Unfortunately, it's not possible to do this using a dynamic 
link library (DLL) due to severe limitations in the Microsoft
linking technology.  Instead, you have to link statically
against the goose.lib library.

Here's how you do it:

1) Put the goose source distribution into a subdirectory
   called "goose" in your project directory.

2) Open the project that should use the goose library.

3) Use the "Project->Insert project into workspace"
   option, and insert the "goose.dsp" project definition
   file into your project.

4) Press F7 to build the goose.lib file.  You can find it
   in the "goose\Library\goose.lib" directory.  It builds
   with a few warnings that you can safely ignore.

5) Now change the project to your own project again with
   the project selection toolbar (or "Build->Set active
   configuration".)

6) Use "Project->Settings..." to edit the properties of
   your project.  Under the "C/C++" tab, select the
   "Preprocessor" category, and add the string
   "goose\src, goose\win32, goose\specfns" to the
   "Additional include directories" input field.

7) Go to the "Link" tab, add "goose\Library\goose.lib"
   to the "Object/Library modules" input field, and press
   "OK".  Now you are ready to link against the goose library.

8) Compile your project, and run it.

There is an example project file that is set up to demonstrate
how these things work.  It's called called "goosetest.dsp".  
Compiling this project will give you an executable that tests 
the ascii import feature.

Compiling the stuff with other compilers should be
relatively straight-forward.  However, don't try
to use the provided project file with Visual C++ 5.0.
Instead, create a new static library project and import all 
the source files into that.


Win32 Compatibility for Unix Contributors
-----------------------------------------

In order to keep the port alive, please observe these things
when you write new code in goose:

#include <config.h>

as the first thing in all *.cpp files.  This is needed to
work around some stupid limitations in the Microsoft compiler.

Use

#include <iostream>
  
instead of #include <iostream.h>.  Using egcs, the two variants
at the same time goes well, but on other platforms, it breaks.
(As could be expected, since this is what the C++ standard
says you should do.)
 
Also, use "using namespace std;" if you use any C++ standard
library things.  This is also a part of the C++ standard.
