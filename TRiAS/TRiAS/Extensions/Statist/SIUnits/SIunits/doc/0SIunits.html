<h2>Overview</h2>


The <var>SIunits</var> package
provides a means of expressing dimensioned quantities,
while checking that expressions combining such dimensioned quantities
do so correctly.
As is the case for C++ type-checking,
this dimension-checking is done at compile-time,
and incurs no runtime cost
in execution speed or additional memory space per variable used.

<p>
The <var>SIunits</var> package provides the following features and benefits:

<ul>
<p><li>
  A means of dimension-checking, done by the compiler,
  in the form of automated type-checking.
  This provides compile-time diagnostics
  in case of a detected mismatch in dimensioned quantities.
  For example, an attempt to sum
  such incommensurate quantities
  as Avogadro's number and the speed of light
  will be diagnosed, causing compilation to fail.

<p><li>
  A uniform scheme for improving the self-documenting nature of code:
  If a quantity <var><b>j</b></var>
  represents, say, current per unit area,
  it is typically clearer to declare

      <font color=darkblue>
      <pre>
        CurrentDensity  j;</pre>
      </font>

    rather than

      <pre>
        double  j;</pre>

<p><li>
  A comprehensive collection of physical constants,
  as well as definitions and names of units,
  using nomenclature that adheres
  to Syst&egrave;me Internationale standards for units and names.
</ul>

The importance of dimension-checking,
and some basics about the <b>SIunits</b> package,
are discussed in
  <a href="http://fnalpubs.fnal.gov/archive/1998/conf/Conf-98-328.ps">
    <i>Introduction to the SI Library of Unit-Based Computation</i></a>.

<p>
This level of dimension-checking
<b>at no runtime cost</b>
is made possible via application of the
sophisticated template mechanism available in standard C++.
A discussion of the techniques employed to achieve this is forthcoming.

<blockquote>
On compilers that are not quite up to standard in treatment of templates,
including at present VC++ 5.0,
the <var>SIunits</var> package provides code compatibility
but not dimension-checking.
That is, correct code written on an ANSI-compliant platform,
making correct use of the dimensioned types and physical constants
in the <var>SIunits</var> package,
will still compile and run properly on these not-yet-standard platforms.
However,
<font color=red>compilation on a non-standard platform
will not check for dimensionally incorrect operations</font>.
It is recommended that code be compiled at some point on a compliant platform,
to check for dimensionally incorrect expressions.
</blockquote>

<p>
This web page presents many practical aspects of using <var>SIunits</var>.


<p><hr><!- ------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<a name="obp"></a>
<h3>Obtaining the Package</h3>

<p>
ZOOM's <var>SIunits</var> packages is in FermiTools,
and the best way to obtain the
sources is via the web page at
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/fermitools">www.fnal.gov/fermitools</a>.
Walk the link to the <var>SIunits</var> abstract,
and from there to obtain the software,
preferably as a tar file.
<p>
The package can be built under any ANSI standard C++ compiler.
Alternatively,
a version of the package without strong dimension-checking
can be built for non-compliant compilers
that have difficulty handling the template features
used by the normal package.
<p>
The package after building includes header files and libraries
for each of five "<a href="#sem">models</a>"
One of these models, for example,
encompasses the Standard International values,
while another provides a system in which
<i>c&nbsp;=&nbsp;hBar&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</i>.
Users select the model according to their needs and preferences.


<a name="utp"></a>
<h3>Using the Package</h3>

<p>
A user's code accesses identifiers in the basic <var>SIunits</var> package
via the following statements:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  #include "SIunits/stdModel.h" // (or whichever model is desired)
  using namespace si;</pre>
  </font>

<p>
The package largely uses self-explanatory names
for its units of measure
(<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>meter</samp>),
for its constants
(<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>lightspeed</samp>s),
and for its types
(<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>Temperature</samp>).
In addition, the user may optionally enable use
of standard short abbreviations
(such as <samp>m</samp> and <samp>c</samp>)
for units and constants:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  using namespace si::abbreviations;</pre>
  </font>

<p>
The complete list of units and constants,
together with their abbreviations,
may be viewed in the package's internal data file
<a href="../SIunits/consts.dat"><u>consts.dat</u></a>.
The full collection of available type names for dimensions
is presented in
<a href="../SIunits/dims.dat"><u>dims.dat</u></a>.
In brief, however, the following naming conventions hold:

<ul>
<p><li>
  Following Syst&egrave;me Internationale conventions,
  all units' names are in the singular
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>joule</samp>
  rather than <i>joules</i>).
<p><li>
  Unabbreviated names of both units and constants
  are primarily in lower case.
<p><li>
  Abbreviated names may be lower case
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>s</samp> [for <samp>second</samp>]),
  upper case
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>K</samp></font> [for <samp>kelvin</samp>]),
  or mixed case
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>GeV</samp> [for <samp>gigaelectronvolt</samp>]),
  also generally following established conventions.
<p><li>
  Greek letters are spelled out,
  and names conventionally written using a subscript
  contain an underscore as a separator
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>mu_0</samp> [permeability of free space]).
<p><li>
  Names of types (dimensions) begin with a capital letter.
  Remaining letters are in lower case,
  except that a name formed by concatenating two (or more) words
  capitalizes each word within the name
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <samp>AngularVelocity</samp>).
  Type names are never abbreviated.
</ul>

<a name="vbu"></a>
<h3>Variables, Base Dimensions, and Base Units</h3>

<p>
Variables are declared using the dimensioned types, as in

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length  l;
  Speed   v;</pre>
  </font>

The set of seven base dimensions defined by Syst&egrave;me Internationale
is found in
<a href="../SIunits/dims.dat"><u>dims.dat</u></a>
under the heading <em>Base Dimensions</em>.

<p>
The value of any variable may be expressed in terms of any of the
units of measure
given in
<a href="../SIunits/consts.dat"><u>consts.dat</u></a>.  For example:
For example, the value of a variable whose dimension
matches one of the base dimensions
(mass, length, time, current, temperature, <i>etc.</i>)
may be expressed in terms of the corresponding base unit, as in:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Mass  mChamber( 112.5 * kilogram );
  Time  tHalf   ( 3 * second );</pre>
  </font>

<p>
Use of non-base units is supported,
as is use of derived (non-base) dimensions:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length  l( 1.6 * micron ); // a non-basic unit of measure
  Speed   v( 60.0 * mph );   // a derived dimension</pre>
  </font>

<p>
You may also form quantities
involving any of the provided <a href="#phc">physical constants</a>
and/or combinations of these constants and various units of measure.
For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Mass    effectiveMass( 1.05 * m_e    ); // m_e is electronrestmass
  Speed   fast( 10000 * meter / second ); // not so fast compared to c!
  Scalar  lincoln( 4 * score + 7       ); // a dimensionless quantity
  Time    t                             ; // implicitly initialized to 0</pre>
  </font>

If a user accidentally attempts to initialize a variable
with a value of an incommensurate dimension,
a compile-time diagnostic will result
(<font color=red>except</font>, as pointed out above,
<font color=red>on a non-standard platform</font>).


<a name="wdq"></a>
<h3>Working With Dimensioned Quantities</h3>

<p>
The following operations on dimensioned quantities are provided:
<ul>
<p><li>
  Copying (<i>e.g.</i>, via assignment, parameter passage, <i>etc.</i>)
  of a quantity of some dimensions
  to another quantity
  <em>of matching dimensions</em>.
  For example,

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Velocity  v( lightspeed ); // copying
  v = v / 2;                 // assignment</pre>
  </font>

<p><li>
  Addition (via the <samp>+</samp> or <samp>+=</samp> operators)
  and subtraction (via the <samp>-</samp> or <samp>-=</samp> operators)
  <em>of quantities with matching dimensions</em>.

  <ul>
  <li>
    Dimensions match
    even if the quantities are or were originally expressed
    in terms of different units of measure.

  <li>
    The result of addition or subtraction
    has the same dimensions as the quantities being combined.

  </ul>

  For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length  len1( 1.2 * meter );
  Length  len2( 4.1 * foot  );
  Length  len3( len2 - len1 ); // fine
  len1 += 3.5 * centimeter;</pre>
  </font>

<p><li>
  Multiplication (via the <samp>*</samp> operator)
  and division (via the <samp>/</samp> operator)
  of quantities with arbitrary dimensions.
  <ul>
  <li>
    The result of multiplication (division) has dimension
    that is the product (quotient)
    of the dimensions of the quantities being combined.

  <li>
    If you store this result,
    it must be copied to a dimensioned quantity
    that matches those resulting dimensions.

  <li>
    Either operand may be a scalar quantity.

  <li>
    Intermediate results may be formed
    even if their dimensions do not match those of any named type.
    (As long as the final result has the proper dimensions,
    the code is physically meaningful.
    See <a href="#dvc">Customized Dimensions</a>
    for further details.)


  </ul>

    For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Time       tim( .1 * second );
  Frequency  frq( 1.5 / tim   );

  Length  len( 1.2 * meter );
  Speed   spd( len / tim   );

  Acceleration  acc( len / tim ); // ERROR: Acceleration is not l/t.</pre>
  </font>

<p><li>
  Multiplication (via the <samp>*=</samp> operator)
  and division (via the <samp>/=</samp> operator)
  of a dimensioned quantity by a scalar right operand.
  The result of such an operation has dimensions
  identical to the dimensions of the left operand.

<p><li>
  Square roots (via <samp>sqrt(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><samp>)</samp>),
  squares (via <samp>sqr(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><samp>)</samp>),
  and other <a href="#spr">powers and roots</a>
  of quantities of arbitrary dimensions.
  For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Energy    e1( 4.5 * joule );
  Mass      m1( 1.0 * gram  );
  Velocity  v1( sqrt(e1/m1) );</pre>
  </font>

<p><li>
  A method <samp>measuredIn(</samp><i>unitOfMeasure</i><samp>)</samp>
  that returns an ordinary <samp>double</samp>
  equivalent to the dimensioned quantity measured in the units specified.

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Time    t    ( 1500000 * second );
  double  tDays( tim1.measuredIn(day) );
  double  weird( lightspeed.measuredIn(furlong/fortnight) );</pre>
  </font>

<p><li>
  A method <samp>pure()</samp>
  that returns an ordinary <samp>double</samp>
  containing the
  value of the dimensioned quantity
  in whatever units are basic to the model used.
  For example, in the standard model,
  this method would provide a length in <samp>meter</samp>s.
  See <a href="#sem">Selecting a Model</a>.
</ul>

All the above operations are fully <samp>inline</samp>d,
so that adding two <samp>Length</samp>s
is precisely equivalent
(in code generated for runtime execution)
to adding two <samp>double</samp>s.

<a name="phc"></a>
<h3>Physical Constants</h3>

<p>
The mathematical and physical fundamental constants discussed by the 1986
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu">CODATA group</a>
are available via this <var>SIunits</var> package.
These constants are listed in
<a href="../SIunits/consts.dat"><u>consts.dat</u></a>
under the heading <em>CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants</em>.
For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  MagneticDipoleMoment myMu( 3 * protonmagneticmoment );
  Temperature          icy( triplepoint );
  Length               holeRadius( 10 * pi * plancklength );</pre>
  </font>

As discussed above,
these constants generally have both full names and abbreviations.
They include:
<ul compact>

<li>
  <samp>pi</samp>,
  <samp>twopi</samp>,
  <samp>halfpi</samp>,
  <samp>pi2</samp>,
  <samp>e</samp>,
  <samp>gamma</samp>
<li>
  <samp>c</samp>,
  <samp>c2</samp>,
  <samp>mu_o</samp>,
  <samp>epsilon_0</samp>
<li>
  <samp>G_N</samp>,
  <samp>G</samp>,
  <samp>hBar</samp>,
  <samp>h</samp>
<li>
  <samp>ePlus</samp>,
  <samp>Phi_0</samp>
    (charge and flux)
<li>
  <samp>m_e</samp>,
  <samp>m_p</samp>,
  <samp>m_n</samp>,
  <samp>m_d</samp>,
  <samp>m_mu</samp>
    (masses)
<li>
  <samp>alpha</samp>,
  <samp>R_inf</samp> (fine structure and Rydberg constant)
<li>
  <samp>N_A</samp>,
  <samp>k</samp>
<li>
  <samp>eV</samp>,
  <samp>amu</samp>
<li>
  <samp>mu_B</samp>,
  <samp>mu_N</samp> (Bohr and nuclear magneton)
<li>
  <samp>m_P</samp>,
  <samp>l_P</samp>,
  <samp>t_P</samp>
    (Planck mass, length, time)
<li>
  <samp>r_e</samp>,
  <samp>a_0</samp>,
  <samp>sigma_e</samp> (classical and Bohr radius, Thomson cross section)
<li>
  <samp>mu_mu</samp>,
  <samp>mu_P</samp>,
  <samp>mu_n</samp>,
  <samp>mu_d</samp> (magnetic moments)
</ul>

<p>
In the future,
as measurements of fundamental constants change
or new constants are added to the list,
the maintenance needed to use the changed values
is just a single change in one place
in <a href="../SIunits/consts.dat"><u>consts.dat</u></a>.
The intent is to keep this list comprehensive,
in particular including those constants
for which various high energy physics packages have need.


<a name="div"></a>
<h3>Displaying Dimensioned Quantities</h3>

<p>
Stream output of a dimensioned quantity is available
via the <samp>&lt;&lt;</samp> operator.
All such output includes unit information.
In the standard model, for example,
a <samp>Length</samp> quantity
is by default displayed as a number of <samp>meter</samp>s.
For example,

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  std::cout << (123 * centimeter) << std::endl;</pre>
  </font>

produces output:

  <pre>
  1.23 m</pre>

<p>
The set of default display units is model-dependent;
for the standard model, this information may be found in
<a href="../src/std/Model.cc">std/Model.cc</a></font>
under the heading <em>Install the default display notation ...</em>.
A user may, however, change these defaults at run time.
Additionally, a user may install (and later update, if desired)
similar defaults for dimensions which have no initial defaults.
The static
<samp>showAs(</samp><i>unitOfMeasure,&nbsp;itsSymbol</i><samp>)</samp>
method
serves both purposes:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length::showAs( inch, "in" );
  std::cout << (123 * centimeter) << std::endl;</pre>
  </font>

produces output:

  <pre>
  48.425197 in</pre>

<p>
Any dimensioned quantity having a derived dimension
for which no default unit has been installed
will be displayed in terms of the default units of the base dimensions.
A change in the default unit of any base dimension
will be reflected in the display of any derived dimension
that does not have its own default unit.


<p><hr><!- ------------------------------------------------------------>
<h2> Advanced Features</h2>

<a name="ptp"></a>
<h3>Power-of-Ten Prefixes</h3>

<p>
All prefixes for multiples and submultiples of ten
specified by Syst&egrave;me Internationale
are provided in the <var>SIunits</var> package.
To use a prefix, multiply it by the unit you wish it to modify:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  std::cout << (123 * deka_ * gram) << std::endl;</pre>
  </font>

<p>
The complete list of prefixes is found in
<a href="../SIunits/consts.dat"><u>consts.dat</u></a>,
under the headings <em>Standard SI prefixes ...</em>.
Note, as illustrated above,
that the name of each prefix
(and of each abbreviated prefix)
concludes with an underscore suffix;
this convention is to suggest
these symbols' intended usage as prefixes.

<p>
For users' convenience,
selected units in common use
(such as <em>centimeter</em>)
have predefined names that incorporate the prefix.
Thus, <samp>centimeter</samp> and <samp>centi_&nbsp*&nbsp;meter</samp>
are equivalent forms from which users may choose.


<a name="spr"></a>
<h3>Powers and Roots</h3>

<p>
The <var>SIunits</var> package provides the following operations
involving powers and roots of dimensioned quantities:

<ul>
  <li>A function
    <samp>sqr(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><samp>)</samp>
    that returns the square of its argument.
    Note that the result of this function
    has dimensions
    that are themselves the squares of the dimensions of the argument.
    In this way,
    the square of a <samp>Length</samp> quantity
    is an <samp>Area</samp>;
    the square of a <samp>Scalar</samp> quantity
    is also a <samp>Scalar</samp>,
    <i>etc</i>.
    For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Area  a( sqr(4 * centimeter) );</pre>
  </font>

  <li>A function
    <samp>sqrt(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><samp>)</samp>
    that returns the square root of its argument.
    Note that the result of this function
    has dimensions
    that are themselves the square roots of the dimensions of the argument.
    In this way,
    the square root of an <samp>Area</samp> quantity
    is a <samp>Length</samp>;
    the square root of a <samp>Scalar</samp> quantity
    is also a <samp>Scalar</samp>,
    <i>etc</i>.
    For example:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length  len( sqrt(16 * hectare) );</pre>
  </font>

    Since the current version of the <var>SIunits</var> package
    requires that all dimensions have integral powers,
    the square root of, say, a <samp>Volume</samp>
    quantity may not be taken.

  <li>A family of functions,
    <samp>Nth&lt;</samp><i>integralLiteral</i><samp>&gt;::pow(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><font color=darkblue><samp>)</samp></font>
    yielding integral powers of the argument.
    (When the <i>integralLiteral</i> is 2,
    we have the equivalent of the <samp>sqr()</samp> function described above.)
    Thus, as shown here,
    cubing a <samp>Length</samp>
    yields a <samp>Volume</samp> quantity:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Volume  v( Nth<3>::pow(4 * centimeter) );</pre>
  </font>


  <li>A family of functions,
    <samp>Nth&lt;</samp><i>integralLiteral</i>s<samp>&gt;::root(</samp><i>dimensionedQuantity</i><samp>)</samp>
    yielding integral roots of the argument.
    (When the <i>integralLiteral</i> is 2,
    we have the equivalent of the
    <samp>sqrt()</samp> function described above.)
    Thus, as shown here,
    taking the cube root of a <samp>Volume</samp>
    yields a <samp>Length</samp> quantity:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  Length  len( Nth<3>::root(0.027 * cubicMeter) );</pre>
  </font>

</ul>

<p>
A user's choice of model affects program development in two ways:

<ol>
<li> Internally, as previously illustrated,
  the program must <samp>#include</samp> the header
  corresponding to the desired model.
<li> Externally,
  the compiled program must be linked
  with the library corresponding to the same model.
</ol>

<p>
The primary advantage of selecting one model over another
lies in the assumptions each makes
and, in consequence, the operations each permits.
For example,
compilation under the standard model does not permit
addition of
<samp>Length</tt></samp>
and <samp>Time</tt></samp> quantities.
To be valid,
such a summation requires the assumption
that the speed of light is unity;
this assumption is built into each of the other models
(as described in the table above),
and so compilation with any of these other models
will permit this sum without complaint.

<p>
It is important to note
that these models are designed
to permit a certain equivalence of programs.
That is,
any program compiled and linked as described above for a given model
will also compile and link
with any model subsequently listed in the above table,
and will produce comparable results.
This is because each model's defining characteristics
are compatible with the characteristics of each subsequent model.

<p>
Only to the extent that a program performs
model-specific calculations
(including use of <samp>pure()</samp>)
will numerical results be affected by the choice of model.
Any other differences are largely cosmetic:
default display units differ from model to model,
but judicious use of the
<samp>displayAs()</samp> function
can compensate for these, if desired.

<h3>Customized Dimensions</h3>

<p>
A user who wishes to use a derived dimension
not already explictly named in
<a href="../SIunits/dims.dat"><u>dims.dat</u></a>
may define and employ a name for the desired dimension:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  CustomDimension( HyperVolume, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 );</pre>
  </font>

The numbers in the above
<samp>CustomDimension()</samp> definition
give the respective powers of the seven base dimensions
that are used to identify a derived dimension.
Here,
<samp>HyperVolume</samp> dimension was defined
as the fourth power of a <samp>Length</samp> dimension.

<p>
Once defined,
the new dimension may be used
wherever a type name may appear,
typically to define a variable of that type:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  HyperVolume  unitTesseract( meter * meter * meter * meter );</pre>
  </font>


<a name="ani"></a>
<h3>Abbreviations and Namespace Issues</h3>

<p>
As mentioned earlier,
a user of <var>SIunits</var> may elect to use abbreviations
provided by the package
(such as <samp>m</samp> for <samp>meter</samp>
and <samp>c</samp> for <samp>lightspeed</samp>):

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  #include "SIunits/stdModel.h" // (or whichever model is desired)
  using namespace si;
  using namespace si::abbreviations;</pre>
  </font>

However, the user code may wish
to have a local integer variable <samp>m</samp>.
This is not as much of an inconvenience as it might first appear.

<p>
The C++ scoping mechanism specifies
that if you define <samp>m</samp> locally
it will hide the globally available <samp>m</samp>.
Also,
the C++ namespace mechanism allows you
to selectively specify the namespace for a given variable name:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  using namespace si::abbreviations;
  using ::m; // use m from the global namespace
             // rather than si::abbreviations::m</pre>
  </font>


<a name="poe"></a>
<h3>Properties of Elements</h3>

<p>
<var>SIunits</var> provides convenient access
to the atomic number and atomic weight
of each of the known chemical elements.
This access is via a separate namespace:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  using namespace si::elements;</pre>
  </font>

Thereafter, a user program may refer to an element by its name,
by its abbreviation, or by its position in the periodic table;
each of the following are equivalent ways
of referring to lithium's atomic weight and so produce identical output:

  <font color=darkblue>
  <pre>
  cout << lithium.atomicweight << endl;
  cout << Li.atomicweight << endl;
  cout << periodictable[3].atomicweight << endl;</pre>
  </font>

<p>
The complete list of available element names
abbreviations, and properties
is found in <a href="../SIunits/elements.dat"><u>elements.dat</u></a>.

<h2>Interpreting Diagnostics</h2>

<p>
A program that contains an error in dimension
will give rise to a compilation error
when compiled with an <var>SIunits</var> library.
Such diagnostics are typically lengthy,
and frequently employ template syntax, in part,
to identify the type or types provoking the error.

<p>
In such cases,
we recommend to pay particular attention
to the numbers found within the angle brackets
denoting a template's arguments.
These numbers will occur in groups of seven,
and represent the contribution of each of the seven base dimensions
to the type involved.
For example, <samp><</samp>...<samp>,2,1,-2,0,0,0,0></samp>
denotes the <samp>Energy</samp> type,
since <samp>Energy</samp> is defined as a
<samp>Length</samp>&sup2;&nbsp;<samp>Mass</samp>&nbsp;per&nbsp;<samp>Time</samp>&sup2;.

<h2>Glossary <font size=-1>(in alphabetical order)</font></h2>

<dl>

<p><dt>
  <b>Base dimension</b>:
<dd>
  Any of the following seven dimensions
  specified by Syst&egrave;me Internationale:
  length,
  mass,
  time,
  temperature,
  current,
  amount of substance,
  luminous intensity.

<p><dt>
   <b>Derived dimension</b>:
<dd>
  A dimension that results
  from a product or quotient of two or more base dimensions.
  "Derived" is the nomenclature specified by Syst&egrave;me Internationale.

<p><dt>
  <b>Dimension</b>:
<dd>
  A measurable or calculable physical property, <i>e.g.</i>, energy.
  (Syst&egrave;me Internationale uses the term "quantity" for this concept.)

<p><dt>
  <b>Dimensioned quantity</b>:
<dd>
  A numeric value together with its (implicit or explicit) units.

<p><dt>
  <b>Model</b>:
<dd>
  Any of the following five sets of header/library pairs
  provided by this package:
    standard,
    relativistic,
    high-energy,
    quantum,
    natural.
  Each model makes different, but internally self-consistent,
  assumptions about the universe
  and so permit different levels of support
  for mixed-dimension computation.
  Details of each model are provided in the <a href="#sem">table</a> above.
