		Notes on an algebra of units

		   W. Brown, M. Fischler



Notation:		a[u] denotes amount a measured in units u


Definition:		a[u] = a / u


Composite rule:		(a/b)[u/v] = a[u] / b[v]


Inversion rule:		a[b/c] = (a * c) / b


Inversion corollary:	1 / a[b/c] = b / (a * c)


Identity:		x[x] = 1


Common units rule:	a[u] / b[u] = a/b


Common amounts rule:	a[u] / a[v] = v[u]


Chain rule:		a[b] * b[c] = a[c]
