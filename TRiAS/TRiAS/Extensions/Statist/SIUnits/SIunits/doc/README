                             ====================

This software has been made freely available with a request for

                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================

SIunits, more formally known as "The SI Library of Unit-Based
Computation," is a software subsystem of libraries and header files that
permit compiler application of strong type-checking to user code dealing
with numeric computation.  Convenience of use, economy of application,
and ease of extensibility are primary objectives.


Documentation
-------------
"Introduction to the SI Library of Unit-Based Computation," presented
at CHEP'98 (Chicago, IL), Sept. 2, 1998; found in doc/intro.tex in
this distribution.  A postscript version of this paper is created as
part of the product installation process.  The paper is also available
on-line at
   http://fnalpubs.fnal.gov/archive/1998/conf/Conf-98-328.html

Additional resources include:
  1) doc/0SIunits.html for additional introductory material and usage tips;
  2) four example programs, three of which contain deliberate errors
     that can be enabled via a #define (to see how the compiler handles
     dimensional errors):
   a) test/example1.cc
   b) test/example2.cc
   c) test/example3.cc
   d) test/ex_Radlen.cc
  3) two programs that validate correct behavior under all models:
   a) test/testconsts.cc (checks values of selected constants of nature)
   b) test/fullTest.cc (comprehensive library exerciser)


Required Hardware and Software
------------------------------
Configuration 1 (recommended):
  a) GNU make
  b) KAI v3.3 C++ compiler.
  c) Fermi Red Hat Linux 5.0.2, IRIX 6.2, or similar operating environment.

Configuration 2 (see note 1):
  a) tar
  b) Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
  c) Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0

Note 1:  Because MS VC++5.0 is not compliant with certain C++ language
features upon which this product depends, this configuration's version
has certain restrictions in its dimension-checking capabilities.  Also,
output under this configuration will not automatically have labels
attached to its dimensioned quantities.


Product Installation
--------------------
Configuration-independent steps (assume source directory hierarchy is to
be rooted at SIunits/):
  1) mkdir SIunits/; cd SIunits/
  2) tar xf ../SIunits.tar

For configuration 1:
  3) manually configure the makefile, especially:
   a) the compiler options for your local operating environment;
   b) tgtdir, the desired local target directory; and
   c) the local command aliases (e.g., LPR)
  4) gmake

For configuration 2:
  3) run Windows NT Explorer
  4) locate and double-click on SIunits/SIunitsWorkspace.dsw
  5) follow instructions in SIunits/doc/README_NT


Running the Software
--------------------
This is not a stand-alone package; it is assumed there is user code
which will make use of SIunits' capabilities.

1) In user's C++ source code, ONE OF the following:
  #include "stdModel.h"
  #include "relModel.h"
  #include "hepModel.h"
  #include "qtmModel.h"
  #include "natModel.h"

2) At link time, link user code against the corresponding library, ONE OF:
  stdModel.a
  relModel.a
  hepModel.a
  qtmModel.a
  natModel.a

                                   SUPPORT
                                   =======

Help with the installation or use of SIunits is available by sending 
mail to

                        SIunits-support@fnal.fnal.gov

which is auto-forwarded to the group in charge of SIunits support at 
Fermilab.

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service 
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use 
and further development.

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of 
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and 
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a 
level of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of 
Understanding process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the 
expectation that it will be read and noted.
